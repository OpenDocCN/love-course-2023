 Welcome to the Fresher podcast man。 We are here with Greg Doucet man。。

So I'm really hyped up for this interview。 Quick announcement guys。 Rumble。com/freshfit。

 Go ahead and check us out over there。，So you know if we get cancelled off YouTube you guys will know exactly where to find us。

，But without further ado man we got a legend in the house。，*音乐*，*音乐*。

Hey Greg so I'm happy to have you on the podcast man。 I know who you are。

 I'm sure a lot of people in our audience know who you are。。

But for those that may not know can you introduce yourself to the people please。。

Well I'm basically a 47 year old man with a 5 foot 6 hundred 80 pounds。。

Professional bodybuilder powerlifter。 I'm on YouTube。，And I've recently turned into a cyclist。

 So I have a mixed bag of information。，I also have a master's degree in kinesiology。

 I've been at this since I was 10 years old。，Done 59 competitions and so I'm ready to talk。，Bam。

 Awesome man。 So can you tell us a little bit about your training and your background。。

Well I started training at 10。 I used to do triathlons。，I was a physical education teacher。

 Taught a bunch of different subjects。，I did that for about 11 years。 And so。。

No I started training at 10。，Ok sorry go ahead。，And then I have my master's in kinesiology。。

So I've been studying about the human body my whole life。。

And I did a lot of powerlifting bodybuilding contests。。

So I have a lot of experience practicing these things。，I've coached thousands of athletes。

 I've been doing it my whole life。，And so now I've transitioned more into doing cardio。。

But I still lift weights。 I still add it 3 days a week。，I'm still staying in good shape。。

And so you know that's it。 That's all I've done。，And you got a bachelor's and a master's degree in kinesiology。

，Can you talk about that a little bit and how it helps you as far as coaching people。。

Well if you don't have an education then how do you know what you're talking about。。

So when I'm making videos talking about things I think back。，Ok I have the education。

 I learned certain things。，But then I was able to apply it on myself and on others like in the real world。

，Because a lot of times you read something。，But then you apply it and you're like that doesn't make sense。

，And so having that experience personal experience as well as the education and coaching others。。

That's what gives me that well rounded bit of information to help everyone。，Nice。Fantastic。。

So you got an IPB Pro card back in 2012 man。，Can you take us through that what the prep was like。。

How long it took you and I mean getting an IPB Pro card is extremely difficult man。。

I think I had the longest journey anyone。，I literally got my Pro card on my 50th competition。。

So I started competing in grade 12。，50th competition。，Mind you I did 42 shows natural。。

And so I was on PDs。，I wasn't natural when I turned pro。，When I was natural I wasn't big enough。。

I was in the 170s。，Got my Pro card。，I was about 195 pounds。。

And the diet I mean it was always dieting。，Like literally。。

I feel like I've been on a diet my whole life。，Greg I'm curious man。。

So I have people that I know are going to competitions right。，And I'm just curious to know。。

How many people in those competitions are actually natural or natty you think。。

At the nationals like the show I did。，Probably no one。，Maybe one。，I mean almost nobody。。

And the ones that are winning nobody。，Like there's no way。。

I did I competed at nationals in the lighter divisions。，Like when I was a lightweight and so on。。

I could win at that level。，But I mean the weight classes are like 150 pounds。。

But at the top level the guys winning Pro cards。，Like when you're 5 foot 6 hundred ninety five pounds with 5 percent body fat。

，You're not natural。，So almost nobody。，OK。，Fair enough。，So when you。，How long did you prep for that。。

And you said you had done 50 shows prior。，Take us through that man。。

And how long have you been training at that point。，I started training at 10。。

I would have been well 2012。，So 11 years ago。，I would have been like 35， 36 years old。。

I mean how long did I train。，Well I did the provincial championships。，I remember I started my diet。。

I was 206 pounds。，I was off gear。，And then I went on gear。，And 6 weeks into my diet。。

I was still 206 pounds。，And then I ended up at the provincials in the heavyweight division。。

Like around 198。，You maintained 206 pounds。，I was dropping fat and putting on muscle at the same time from going on cycle。

，And so I made it to the stage。，I was 198 pounds。，I was heavyweight for the first time。。

And I won heavyweight and overall。，And then I competed a week later。。

And I got beat by the lightweight in the overall。，And everyone's like there's no way you're winning that。

，You can't even beat a lightweight。，I'm like watch me。，I'm going to do it。，And so I just kept going。。

And I got even leaner。，I showed up to the nationals like in the lower 190s。，Went on way more gear。。

Like doubled everything up。，Added in trend。，I went on as much of anything as I could handle。。

And showed up and won the show。，And got my pro card。，Greg。。

How much is it mindset over for example like body composition。，So I feel like when it's the mindset。。

When you're going to win， you win。，First when you just come in。，The body's like ok。，You're the body。。

But like are you ready to win the show。，Honestly if you don't have like an obsessive personality。。

Like you're not like addicted to success。，There's no way you can compete in bodybuilding at that level。

，The diet people don't understand how hard it is。，Like most people they're like oh I don't want a burger。

，I'm craving a burger and fries。，And they can't do it。，They might die to like 10 percent。。

But I'm telling you every percent leaner。，It's 10 times harder。，You get to 6 percent。。

You're shredded。，You're not even close to ready。，To get a pro card you need to be mind blowing shredded。

，And so everyone can do it。，But do they want to or should they。，Probably not。。

And so I think what helped me is I had this obsessive personality。，To be the best at everything。。

Like I just put everything into everything I wanted to do。。

Whether it was school or a job or anything。，I always worked so hard。。

And so I took on bodybuilding as a huge challenge。，I'm like I'm going to do it。。

It's kind of like David Goggins。，Like you don't know me。，You don't know what I'm about。。

I'm going to put everything into this。，And it came out on top eventually。，After 50 times trying。。

And you know I think people kind of underestimate the difficulty it takes to get extremely lean。。

Once you're you know when you're at 10 percent body fat you look pretty damn good。。

You know you're on the beach。，Your veins are popping。，Abs are showing。，You look really good。。

But once you get to like you know sub 10 percent。，You know you're going from 7 percent to 6 percent to 5 percent。

，Each percentile is a significant increase in your dieting。，How you have to have things on point etc。

，Can you talk about how。，Because I've said this before。。

Typically the better you look the worse you feel。，I can't express how horrible I felt dieting like to this level。

，Like essentially the last month I can barely function as a human being。。

Like no matter how good your diet is。，How much training you have。。

No matter how many drugs you're taking。，And I was on all of them。。

I had to get my girlfriend sometimes to get me out of the bathtub。。

I couldn't drive myself to the gym sometimes。，Shoulder check。，I'm getting in car accidents。。

I crashed my car underground one time。，I'm in a mess。，Like I'm wrecked。，That's how I feel。。

I'm wrecked。，That's how hard it is。，And it's like you just keep going。。

And the only reason I did this is because I was so good at it。。

I was so determined to reach that goal。，It's kind of like climbing Mount Everest。。

Every step higher towards the top it's that much harder。，It's thin air。，The bottom it's easy。。

Halfway up you're like， "Ah， it's not bad。"，But man， when you're at the top it's so hard。。

You can't live up there。，And so you have to come back down the mountain。。

And that's why people are bulking and cutting as bodybuilders。，Because you can't maintain 3， 4。

 5 percent body fat year-round。，And you would just fall apart。。

I couldn't physically nor mentally handle that。，So it is that hard。。

And I would argue harder than you think to be that lean。，Absolutely。。

I remember I bulked up all the way up to 250 for me。，That was fat。，And then I got down。。

I would say maybe 9， 8 percent body fat。，Obviously nowhere near going on stage。。

But you start to have libido issues。，You start to get really tired。，You start to get irritable。。

Everything pisses you off。，You have very little energy to do anything outside of train。。

And how long did that prep take you for the IFBB？，How long did you prep for？，6 months， 8 months？。

Honestly， I was dieting the whole year，because I competed in that provincial championship where I won。

，And then the next week， I had the Atlantic。，And then I was， I think。

 12 weeks out from the nationals。，And so I just kept dieting。，Like I didn't diet as hard。。

But I was always single-digit body fat。，I mean， I didn't have much energy the entire time。。

And that last month， like for me， when I'm at like 6 percent，，it's like from then on。

 it's like I can't function。，I can't do anything。，I remember I did this natural back in the day。。

I was a school teacher。，I'd have to show up。，I could hardly keep my eyes open。。

I couldn't concentrate。，You have to be nice。，I'm a school teacher。，I have kids all day long。。

So I had to hold it in。，So you learn how to become more intrinsic with yourself。。

Like you hate the world。，You don't feel good。，But you have to be nice， polite， smile to kids all day。

，And I'm like losing my mind。，Like you want to say like shut up， but you can't。，And so it was hard。。

But I'm telling you， even with drugs， even with steroids，，all that's-- everything in the world，。

it's still a nightmare。，It's still absolutely nearly impossible to do。，So 2 questions for you。。

Number 1， what should an average guy that's natty，，that isn't trying to compete or step on stage。

be at as far as body fat percentage to look attractive？，That's part 1。，And then part 2。

 can you take us through gear usage，and should guys consider it？，Should they not？。

Give us the pros and cons。，And you've been really transparent about gear usage，。

which I think why so many people love you。，Some great questions。，Hopefully I'll remember all of them。

，I'll start with the first one。，For just general fitness and health for men，，it's 15%。。

And women add on 9%。，There's essential fat that women have to have。，So a woman， 15%。

 it's going to be shredded。，For men， 15% is going to look amazing。。

And I actually did a video on this。，What body fat percentage do women prefer？。

And anywhere from 10% to 15% for like 90% of women，，that's where they're going to like。。

Not many girls are going for that shredded，，single-digit body fat。，They just don't like as much。。

For general aesthetics， 10% to 12% is going to be shredded。，And for athletic performance，。

that's usually where I try to get someone。，15% just for general health，。

like you're going to feel good。，You're going to look good。，Anything lower than 15%，。

it's not going to make you healthier，or more like live longer。，But in general，。

it's going to make you look a little bit better，to the opposite sex depending on the person。。

And so I would recommend 15% body fat for these people。，And so what's the next question？。

And then the second question was，you're very transparent about gear usage，and gear in general。，Yeah。。

Which I think is why so many people respect you。，We got a lot of fake natties running around。。

We'll talk about fake natties as well，on your YouTube channel here in a second。，Facts。。

But can you tell us a little bit about，how prevalent gear usage is。

and why you chose to be so transparent about it？，There's way more people on， I'll call it gear。。

I'll call it performance-enhancing drugs than people think。，And so for example，。

people will often ask， steroids， steroids。，More people are on SARMs than steroids。。

And SARMs are selective endogen receptor modulators，which are band performance-enhancing drugs。。

Like they're easier to get。，They're often not used with a needle。。

And so people are more comfortable with that。，And so it's way more common than people think。。

I would say probably one out of every four people，that are at the gym that you see looking。

and walking around are on it。，And oftentimes it's not the person that looks like me。。

I'm only on 140 milligrams of test a week。，I've been on HRT。，I haven't done a cycle。。

I'm not doing peptides。，Nothing else for nearly four years now。。

But mostly people look at the biggest guy in the gym，and think that person's on it。。

But they're not thinking about the people，that are， for example， 30% body fat，and have no muscle。

and they just want to look average。，They just want to be able to take their shirt off。

in the summer and just fit in and look average。，Those people are on steroids。。

I know that because I sold it to them。，Like I used to sell steroids。，And so I knew that。，I was like。

 y'all think it's this， this， and this guy。，And I'm obviously not telling anyone who's doing it。。

But most of the time， it was average-looking people，that just wanted to fit in and be okay。。

And those are the ones that were doing it。，Men and women。，You know what's funny， man？。

So I'm in the gym now training a lot more as well， right？，And like my trainer's telling me，，Yo， bro。

 those guys you see nowadays，，especially that compete， are using that stuff。。

And it's like it's unfair，because you can't really go in there naturally，because once again。

 everyone's on it。，Yeah， everyone's on it。，Now， how long did you train naturally。

before you decided to go to the dark side？，I was in my 30s。，So we're talking over 20 years。。

I'd done 42 shows natural before I did anything。，I would go into natural contests，without even--。

I don't want to say I didn't have to try，，but it was excessively easy，to win a drug-tested contest。

because the level of physique was night and day。，And then when you enter an enhanced contest，。

all of a sudden， I'm just one of the normal guys。，Like you go from really excelling in a drug-free event。

to being just average or below average，once you can do anything you want。，Huge difference。，Now。

 for the audience that might not understand，or know this world of performance-enhancing drugs，。

can we go over the main big ones，that people typically use and how they work？。

The main steroids that people take？，Yeah， and--，because we know we're making jokes，，oh， yeah， Trenin。

 SARMs， and Anivar，，and all this other stuff， and testosterone。，People might not know the difference。

，Can you give the people a quick little--，As far as steroids go， by far，。

like not even-- nothing even close。，Like more people use this，than every other thing put together。。

It'd be testosterone。，That's the basic male hormone。，That's what I'm on right now。。

That's what my doctor prescribes。，Everything else is basically，a derivative of that。。

It's basically testosterone，made in a different way，to give you a different kind of look。

just to keep things simple。，And so most people are just using testosterone，at various doses。，However。

 there's orals，，and so a lot of people are taking，something like Anivar，。

which would be probably the most common drug，for women， but it has a lot less side effects，。

a lot less water and bloating，，and although it's more expensive。。

So a lot of people are taking Anivar。，A lot of people would take Anivar。

before they take an injectable，because not everyone's comfortable injecting。。

So they don't want to do that。，Something like D-ball，would be very common， very popular，。

but it's gonna make you a lot more puffy，，holding a lot of water。，Something like Tren，。

although everyone jokes about it，，it's not used nearly as much，。

maybe 20% as much as actual testosterone。，It's so much stronger。，It makes you feel horrible。。

It gives you insomnia，，just an uneasy feeling，like you just don't feel good on it。。

Like every time I use Tren，，I couldn't wait for it to stop，versus if I'm using testosterone，。

I feel like Superman all the time。，Tren makes you feel like shit，，but you look great。。

So that's the trade-off。，Gotcha。，What would your message be，to anyone that's thinking about。

potentially going down，the road of the dark side？，The problem with it is。

once you've had a taste for it，，it's very hard to stop，because you're gonna lose。

at least half the gains，that you made while you're on it。，You're not gonna feel as good。

after you stop。，Your sex hormones go in the dump。，I mean，that's on top of it。。

Is it legal in your country？，Like in Canada， it's legal。，I can actually use it。。

You can't get in trouble。，Other countries， it may not be legal。，But the downfall really is。

that addictive nature，to feeling how you feel on it，，and so it's very hard to stop。。

And so the problem，，people are like，，I'll just do one cycle。，I'll put on 20 pounds of muscle，。

which they're not going to，，one in a hundred might，，and then they think，，I'll just keep it and stop，。

and I'll be good。，But the problem is，，they go on，，get half the results they thought，they'd get，。

then they get off of it，，and then they feel like shit。，They can't get an erection。。

They can't have sex。，They're like，，this sucks，，and they go back on it，，and then they say，，well。

 I did the same dose。，I didn't get the same results，because your body gets used to it。，You need more。

，You double the dose。，You double the dose。，Pretty soon，，you're doing 3，000 milligrams a week。。

You start at 3，400， 500，，and you're not getting any better。，So that's a big problem。。

I'm not going to lie， Greg。，I just don't want to lose my balls。，Smaller balls。

makes your dick look bigger，，so that is not a problem。，I've always said，。

and I want to get your take on this， Greg，，what you think。，I've always said，。

if you're not competing to become a pro，，you're not chasing a pro card，。

you're not a fitness influencer，where your image is literally，how you make your money，。

and train naturally，for at least 5 to 10 years。，Figure out the rudimentary basics。。

Then if your income，is absolutely dependent upon it，，whatever it may be，。

and you have no other choice，，then I guess maybe you can，maybe come to that conclusion，。

but I tell people all the time，，stay natural as long as you can。。

Try to avoid going down the dark side，if you can，，and honestly，，if your income。

isn't dependent upon it，，probably isn't worth it，man。，I mean，，what are your thoughts on that？。

I have the opposite opinion，of what most people。，Most people are like，，if you're not competing，。

you shouldn't use it。，My advice， obviously，，is don't use it ever。，You obviously shouldn't。。

And if you do，，take the lowest dose，that makes you happy。，So rather than thinking，I'll take 500，。

if 200 is enough，，take 200。，But obviously，，ask your doctor。，Don't break the law。，But my take is this。

，People say，，oh，yeah，，you don't need it，because you're not competing。。

The person that's not competing，is the average。，Like，，take a 2 on 10 body。，Their dream would be。

to have a 5 on 10 body。，Just average。，I just love to be average。，That person，，to me，。

is just as much right，as the 9 on 10 Chad，that wants to look like，Chris Bumstead，and win the Mr。

Olympia。，I see no difference，on someone's desire，to improve their physique，。

whether they're 250 pounds，of muscle，and need 10 more，to win the Olympia，versus a guy。

who's 150 pounds，，30% body fat，and just wants to get a girlfriend，，just wants to get looked at。

for once。，I see no difference in that。，So I've had this debate，a lot with people。。

Most people disagree with me，，but I'm a guy that thinks，I don't care where you start。，To me，。

they have just as much reason，to use something，as somebody who's like，at that elite level。，Yeah。。

And I would agree。，I see。，I agree that， you know，，people shouldn't use it at all，。

but let's be honest here。，A lot of times，，guys ask you just--，and they're going to take it anyway，。

so I look at it like，，damn， dude，，if I could stave it off，and tell you， you know，。

train 5 to 10 years at least，，maybe they'll be able，to build a good physique，that they're happy with。

in that 5 to 10 years，and they'll say，，you know，，a lot of times they ask you advice，。

but they never follow it anyway。，Yeah。，And to say 5 to 10 years，，almost nobody。

lasts 5 years in the gym，before they take anything。，You're right。，Almost nobody。

lasts 5 years in the gym， period。，Like I coached--，I used to coach powerlifting，in high school kids。。

There isn't one kid，that's still powerlifting right now。，There were some that were--。

two of them went，to the world championships。，They don't keep going。，People join the gym。。

They have newbie gains。，It's fun。，And after 2 or 3 years，，the gains slow down so much。

that they just don't enjoy it，because they don't see that change，from day to day。。

And same thing as dieting down。，Somebody's overweight。，They can lose 100 pounds quickly，。

but it's 10 times harder，to put on muscle，than it is to lose fat。，And so people who are--。

their goal is to build muscle，，they might gain 3， 4，，maybe 5 pounds in a year，if they're lucky。

after the first years。，And so they don't want to do it。，And so most people，that take steroids。

are doing so，within the first 2 or 3 years，of training。，They're not waiting。，Yeah。。

They get addicted to those fast gains，with the newbie gains。，And， you know，，after 2 or 3 years。

is literally addicting。，And then after that，，your gains drop off dramatically。，So I could see that。

that's a good point，that you make there。，Why so many people，go to the dark side，after 2 to 3 years。

because they're like，，I want these gains fast again。，And so my advice。

is to really slow down your progress。，I was personally very fortunate。，I started training at 10。。

So you think，，well，all your newbie games，would have been done，by the time you're 20。。

But while doing this，，I started doing triathlons at 13。，And so I was doing， like， you know，。

3 to 5 hours of cardio a day，doing--，I was doing，for years doing this。，And so the amount of muscle。

I was putting on，through my teenage years，was very， very--，it was highly reduced，，like， very hard。。

I was doing， like，，20 hours of cardio a week。，And so throughout，my high school years。

and then in my--，in university，，I was bodybuilding，doing triathlons at the same time。。

So my gains were very slow。，They were halted。，And so when I finally got，into my 20s，。

I needed to take，bodybuilding more serious。，I stopped doing triathlons，，focused on bodybuilding，。

and my gains kept going，at a pretty good rate。，And so I had that dopamine，。

that rush of seeing my physique，improve every single year，for a lot longer，than most people。。

I think if I hadn't，had done triathlons，，I would have been a lot better，。

a lot bigger in my early 20s，，and I would have probably stopped，，and I would have probably。

been tempted to use steroids，a lot younger。，But for me，，as long as I was improving，。

I didn't--I didn't feel，I need to take anything。，I didn't compare myself to others。，I was winning。

every show I did practically。，So I'm like，，I'm winning the shows。，I'm natural。。

I'm better than I was last show。，And so I didn't see the need。，But eventually，，I hit a plateau。。

I wasn't improving，，and I wasn't getting，a pro card。，I was winning the drug-tested。

Canadian nationals overall，，and I was like，，no pro card。，I wanted to turn pro，。

so I had to join the dark side。，That's literally what happened。，Yeah。，Greg，，let's say I'm a beginner。

 right？，I don't want to get into，，like， the fitness world，，so to speak，，but I want to add something。

to this regimen，I'm doing right now。，Should it be a protein powder，，creatine，，or even， like。

 growth hormone？，What should it be，that I should start with，as a beginner？。

If you're in your teenage years，，I don't advise adding anything，，but if there was one thing，that was。

 like，，the newbie starter thing，，it would be creatine，，I would have to say。，Creatine， for sure，。

as a young kid，，but the number one supplement，，I would say，，for an adult to take，would be NMN。，NMN，。

it's been promoted by Andrew Huberman，on the Joe Rogan podcast。，It's actually--，that--，where is this？

，Right there。，There you go。，It's the NMN。，That is the number one supplement。。

It slows the aging process。，It gives you more，cardiovascular ability。，It's been shown in， like，。

double-blind human，placebo-controlled studies。，This stuff is amazing。，It--，Yeah， this--。

this is a supplement to take。，Like， if you're into hard training，，'cause you can--。

you can recover better between sets。，You have more energy，，and it's human studies，proving this stuff。

，It's not， like， my studies。，No negative side effects，，and so， for me，，if I had to take between。

 like，，creatine and this，，it's like a no-game--，it's like no contest，，but I'm 47。。

I want to live a long life，，and， you know，，other benefits，，better sleep， feel better，，increased mood。

，I mean， to me，，that's the best，，'cause if you take this，，you can train harder。，The harder you train。

，the more your results。，Creatine， pretty much，the most studies，，like a thousand studies，。

they say you'll probably put on，about 2 to 3 pounds of muscle，，which， to me，，that's fantastic，。

but that's it。，It's gonna build muscle。，It's not really，making you live longer。。

It's not improving your cardio，，so if you had to pick，between those two，，that's the--。

that's what I'd do，，but for a younger person，，probably have less money。，Creatine，。

the cheapest supplement that works。，Protein powder is great，，but you can get it in food。。

You don't need protein powder。，The only reason I use protein powder。

is 'cause I love it in my recipes，and stuff like that。，I have a sweet tooth，。

so that's why I eat protein powder。，Got it。，Going back，，can you repeat it for the audience。

one more time，，'cause they're， like， calling it--，what is it called？，NMN？，NMN。，It's in GO2 Max，。

but you can get it，，but it's actually been recently banned，by the FDA in the United States，。

not around the world，，because they're trying to label it，as a drug。，They're saying，，what it is is。

pharmaceutical companies，who are making billions，and trillions of dollars。

recognize just how good this stuff is，，and they're like，，we want to make the money，。

so they're trying to say，supplement companies，shouldn't be allowed to sell it，。

and so we're working on that。，It's been fighting。，We're lobbying to try，to reverse the decision。。

They did the same thing on NAC，，or N-A-C，，something to help your liver。，I wanted to put that。

in my liver support supplement，，and then we had to take it out。，The FDA was cracking down on it。。

They banned it being sold on Amazon。，It was banned on March 13th，on Amazon， this NMN，。

but they did the same thing，to NAC，，but they recently reversed the ban，，so I'm hoping that they say，。

come on，，it's got no negative side effects。，It's not a great area right now，in the United States。。

It's legal in Canada，，but just in the States，it's banned right now。，Yes。

 and it's not even banned by WADA，，so you can use it in the Olympics。，You can use it in，，for example。

 the UFC，，and so I'm like，，why are you banning this stuff？，Imagine banning caffeine。。

You can't get your coffee，at the friggin' Starbucks。，You'd have to go to your local drugstore。

to get a caffeine。，Caffeine fix。，It's crazy。，And creatine，，yeah， definitely，。

the most widely researched，sports supplement。，There's thousands of studies，on creatine。。

Get the basic monohydrate， guys。，Five， ten grams a day，，you'll be fine。，It takes about， what，。

three weeks to load into the muscles，，if I'm not mistaken， Greg，，and then at that point，。

you'll notice gains。，Yeah， five grams a day，for most people，is going to be more than enough。。

Three grams for a lot of people，would be enough。，I mean， if you have maybe，one in a hundred people。

need more than like six grams，，but yeah， it's certainly going to work。，After a few weeks，。

saturates in your blood。，Just use it long term。，You don't need to load on it。。

You don't need to cycle off。，It's not going to make you fat。，It's just water in the muscle，。

increased energy。，It combines with ADP，to form ATP，，what the energy you need to use。

for like lifting weights and so on。，So definitely a supplement you'd want。，And guys。

 don't worry for the chat。，Don't worry。，We're going to have a Q&A，at the end with the chat。。

So don't worry if you guys，haven't have any questions for Greg。，Go ahead and shoot them in now。。

I see the chats are piling up。，I got one more question， though，，before we get into the chats。。

So Greg， me and you，are going to be doing a Q&A，with the Canadian Border Service。，So Greg。

 me and you，were kind of having a laugh，about this before。，So you ended up getting。

in a little bit of trouble， right，，with CBSA，，Canadian Border Services Agency，，if I'm not mistaken，。

is the correct acronym。，Yeah。，Can you tell us about that a little bit？。

And it was days after you won your Pro Card。，Four days after I got my Pro Card。，So I'm on cloud nine。

，I got new sponsorship contracts。，I'm making money。，I'm like， I can't believe I've done this。。

My dream， my goal。，And then I get arrested，selling steroids，and importing them for another country。。

And so I ended up with，20 months house arrest，，$50，000 fine， give or take。，And that was years ago。。

So I couldn't get into the United States。，Criminal record。，Couldn't teach school。。

So I had to start my career over。，I was like， what am I going to do？，So I just kept coaching。。

Started a YouTube channel。，So I got to coach more people，around the world to spread this out。。

But right now I've hired lawyers。，I'm trying to get in the United States。。

I went to the border recently。，They detained me。，I'm like， I'm just here to get a waiver。。

I'm there for four and a half hours，trying to sneak a text to my lawyer，saying like。

 what are they doing here？，I can't leave， but I'm not under arrest。，Bunch of bullshit。。

But hopefully they're going to let me in。，They kind of like examine what have you done。，I'm like。

 well， I have business，in the United States and so on。，It's been 10 years。。

I haven't done any criminal anything。，So let me in， please， type of thing。，Hopefully I get in。。

We'll see what happens。，Should find out soon。，And because I know some of you guys，are wondering like。

，yo， why is he in studio， etc。？，We tried to make the interview happen，here in Miami， guys。

 but we couldn't，because he couldn't come in。，I haven't been able to get on so many。

people like I get asked all the time。，Huge like， you know， 100 million followers，。

like big channels that I'm like，，I'm unfortunate。，I can't get in。，And so， yeah。

 it's not great for business。，They're definitely holding me back。，But I'm hoping they'll let me in。。

You can always call Drake， bro。，He got Gucci man in。，No， no， no。，It's him。，He's in Canada。。

He's trying to come to United States。，Oh， vice versa。，He can work it out。，Call Drake， man。。

I don't think Drake will answer my text message。，That would be great if he did。，This guy， man。，Yo。

 it's Coach Greg Drake。，Do you need a personal trainer？，Let's hook up。，Yeah， it's other way around。。

Yeah， because Gucci has a criminal history。，So like the way it works，。

and this is me coming from former law enforcement，，like Canadians have access to U。S。

 law enforcement，，law enforcement records and vice versa。，So Gucci man had a conviction，。

a felony convictions in the U。S。，So Canada wouldn't let him in。，And it goes the other way around。。

If you have convictions in Canada，，they're not going to let you into United States。。

So it's kind of like a weird situation。，But yeah， hopefully they'll let you in， man。。

I mean it's been a while。，Canada is a visa waiver free country anyway。。

So hopefully we'll be able to do an interview。，I'm hoping for the best， that's for sure。。

So tell us about like how did you overcome that？，Because at that point， right，。

you obviously ended up getting a low。，So you're on this high。，You get your pro card。，It's awesome。。

Your sponsorships are hitting you up。，You've still got your teaching job。，You're thinking，，damn。

 I'm ready to be an entrepreneur。，Next thing you know， bam， you get arrested。，$50，000 worth of fines。

，You get a felony conviction in Canada。，You end up losing your job。。

Tell us how you were able to build yourself up，back from that。，Well， yeah， I mean I was--。

I literally was sitting on the floor。，I had a cardboard box with my like laptop and stuff。。

And I'm like， you know，，I'm eating with like plastic forks。，I have no money。，I owe the lawyers money。

，I owe the fine。，I haven't paid that off。，And they gave me 10 years to pay it。。

I paid it off in a few years。，YouTube did well。，I ended up paying that off。。

But I had to start from scratch。，And so I kept coaching people。，Now that I have a pro card，。

it was-- getting a pro card，，it's kind of like having a PhD。，People like suddenly recognize you as，。

OK， this guy knows what he's doing。，I'm like， I always knew what I was doing。，I was just natural。。

That's why I wasn't as jacked。，But once you take steroids，，you get so much bigger， obviously。。

People are like， wow，，he looks like he knows what he's doing。。

And so I got more and more people to hire me。，And then eventually I'm like，。

I need to expand out of Halifax，because like locally，，there's only so many people you can coach。。

I started doing educational videos on nutrition，，on anything in general。。

And because I had a teaching background for 11 years，。

I was able to explain things in a way that I felt was--，well。

 at least I hope people think is interesting，，funny， educational，。

and so that they can get some information from that。，And so I kept growing as a channel。。

And the more people saw me talking about these things，，the more they kind of liked what I was saying。

，the more people were calling me up，，hiring me for coaching。，That became absolutely amazing。。

I couldn't believe I was coaching 100 hours a week。，I was coaching 60 plus clients，。

charging a fair bit of money for it too，and doing really well。，But I was like，。

I can't keep doing this forever。，And so I then said，，well。

all these recipes that are making me stand out，from everyone else，，because most coaches，。

it was how much chicken， broccoli and rice can eat，，or is it asparagus or is it fish？，And I was like。

，no，I eat freaking French toast，and I eat freaking lasagna。，I eat all this amazing food all the time。

，They're like， what？，And so everyone I coach was like，，this is my diet。，And they're like，。

I can't believe you're eating that。，And so it kept spreading。，More and more people got that，。

made a cookbook，，started selling that。，One day I sold 100--，or how was it？，1，004 copies in one day，。

$100 a copy。，I was like，，this is ridiculous。，And so I was like，，I don't need to coach as many people。

，So I kept making more of these books。，I've now transitioned into supplements。。

So I do a little bit of the coaching，，you know， supplements， cookbooks。，I've written training books，。

a diet book。，And so I've just been active。，I've been working really hard，for the last several years。。

And I'm trying to work less now，because I felt like I did the grind，and now I can kind of like。

work a normal amount of hours。，But that's what led me to this point。。

Was that like your first big Internet check？，Like everyone remembers，that first big Internet check。。

Was it selling those first 1，000 copies，of your book and you made like 10K in a day，and you're like，。

holy crap， like--，It was 100，000 in a day。，100。，That was like ridiculous。。

I was making a lot before--，no， it wasn't my first。，I was making like maybe。

three quarters of a million at the time。，But then I had the book，and it just went ridiculous。。

And I was like，，I can't--like at that point，，like the dopamine rush was so--。

like I've never been that high in my life。，Like I'm driving around like--。

I can't believe what's happening。，Like how is this possible？，I was just so excited and so happy。。

I've never been that pumped in my life。，And so I just kept it。，How long did it take？，Sorry。，Sorry。

 I didn't mean to cut you off。，Finish and then I'll ask you the second part。。

I've never felt that excited in my life。，And so， you know，，since then the YouTube game，。

it's been fun for me。，I love making videos。，I love making content。，I love the drama。。

I love all of it。，I like the haters， the comments。，The haters are what actually helps me the most。。

If I didn't have people shitting me，or people shitting on me，，like that cookbook went viral。

because people were like，，how dare you sell a book for that much money？。

Everyone's making these videos。，And then I promoted this one channel，，The Iron Musket，。

who he basically just said，，I made this--I ate from this book，and here's the recipes and it worked。。

And I just did a video about him。，And I'm like， wow，，this guy that doesn't know me liked the book。。

And then everyone started eating from my book，，all these famous guys，。

not famous--I did videos about everyone。，And then it became like a meme，，a viral thing，。

and it took off。，And so the entire world started eating from my book。。

It became like this huge big seller for me。，And that was like amazing。，So I did the version 2。。

Version 3。0 is coming out next month。，And so the books have been amazing。，And I've transitioned--。

why do I keep doing that--，to the supplements over here。，And so， so much going on。。

And because I have like a large--，I get about 20 million views per month。，Because of that，。

I have a lot of people that are watching my videos。，And they talk about something like this。。

It works。，It's free advertisement。，Yeah。，So at this point，，so you obviously hit rock bottom。

when you're arrested by the customs authorities，out there in Canada。，They raid your house。。

You lose everything。，How long did it take you to build yourself back up。

to the point where you're making，three quarters of a million dollars，within a few weeks？，I mean。

 that time in my life was very--，I went through a lot of counseling，because I mean， I'm rock bottom。。

I'm talking like almost every friend，ever had wouldn't talk to me。，Everyone's scared of me。。

They're accusing me of this。，It was a nightmare situation。，I mean。

 I'm on a house arrest sitting at home。，So that was a hard time to go through。，But I just said，。

I'm not going to give up。，I'm going to keep doing this。，I was still a professional bodybuilder。。

So I was allowed out of the house，to go to the gym and train。，So I kept going at it。。

And so I would say it took until like 2000，and probably 19 before I started。

making decent money again。，So I was not doing very well。，I would make， I don't know，，like $50。

000 a year coaching or whatever，，like just a normal income。，And I eventually bought a house。

with my girlfriend and she owns Pet Value。，So we kind of bought the house together。。

I didn't have the credit，，but together we could。，We bought a house。。

And then by the time I moved in the house，，I was doing so well on YouTube。，I'm like。

 we need to buy another house。，It was just like--，It happened really quick。，-When did you make--。

So 2012， you get arrested。，2019， things start to pick up，and take off a little bit。。

When did you make the YouTube channel？，-2006。，And so I was posting videos。

just basically trying to show off，，like look how strong I am。，I can bench press this and this。。

It wasn't like I didn't know what a follower，or a sub was or any of that stuff。，And then in 2012。

 I was putting，more and more content。，It kept going。，And then I would stop for a while。

and start back。，I'd be like， it's not doing that well。，I wasn't getting the views。。

And then I look back and I'm like，，wait a minute。，This video on Anubar has 600，000 views。。

I think I'm going to do more videos，on anabolic。，So I do--，This is the pros and cons of D-ball。。

This is the pros and cons of testosterone。，So I was doing videos，on all the different supplements，。

anabolic stuff， like everything。，Sarms， all of it。，Those were getting tremendous views。。

And I literally just took my phone，，propped it up and just spoke。，And before that。

 I was trying to sound smart，，trying to sound professional。，I'm like， I'm just going to rant， talk。

and just say whatever the hell，comes to my mind。，People love those videos。，And so that really。

 really，，really helped me a lot。，People were hiring me all the time。，I'm just looking。。

Am I saying something？，Oh， OK。，Anyway， yeah， I did more of those，，did the Naturonauts。。

And at that point， I was like，，this is crazy。，It really went from nothing。

to huge in a matter of months。，And I think the transparency is huge。

because so many fitness influencers， right？，And you were kind of doing this。

before a lot of these other guys，were scared to talk about that stuff。。

And you were always very transparent about it，，open about it。，And I think that's why。

you have the following that you have，because so many people，kind of shy away from it。

because they don't want to lose sponsorships。，They're scared of being， you know，，looked at as like。

 oh， you're using steroids。，But in reality， when you're honest about it，。

people gain a lot more respect for you。，Yeah， I'm like， it was obvious。，I mean。

 people think I'm on steroids now。，I mean， I'm an HRT。，But I was like way bigger。，It was so obvious。。

Like， am I going to sit here，and be like I'm natural？，Like， no， I'm just going to be honest。。

I'm just an open book。，Like， I don't care。，I'll tell you whatever。，You know， most people are like，。

Gregg， you should not talk so much，about certain things。，I'm like， I don't care。。

I don't have any tact。，I just say what I think。，And so people just like the abrasiveness，。

the openness， the honesty。，And I think it really helped my channel。，And I'm the same way now。，I just。

 I don't do as many videos，about steroids。，And people are like， why don't you do it？，I'm like。

 I've already covered them all。，Like， what am I supposed to do？，The same video again？。

So that's why I've branched out，into different topics。，I like to talk about what's trending，。

things on the Internet， different people。，And people like the videos。。

I do pretty much two videos a day。，I've been doing that for like，three years straight now。。

And I think that the more videos you post，，the more chance people are going to，see what you're doing。

and more plants are going to follow you。，And don't worry， guys。。

We're going to get into the spicy stuff，here a little bit。，But I want you guys to really get to know。

this individual right here，because I'm excited for this interview。，So your cookbook did really well。。

You were selling it for about a hundred bucks。，People were hating on you。

because you were selling it for a hundred bucks。，Tell us about the book game， man。，What's it like？。

Because I just released my own book，about a month and a half ago or so。，And you know。

 it did pretty well。，But the book game is a whole other thing， man。，Can you tell us about writing it。

 putting it out？，I don't know。，You independently published it， I'm assuming， right？。

Or did you go to a publisher？，Yeah， individually。，How did you go about making the book？。

And what sparked you to make a cookbook？，Well， I couldn't do the coaching。。

And I was actually very nervous to do this book，because I thought， well，。

no one's going to hire me for coaching。，But it's like I was getting so popular on YouTube。

and I was reading comments like，，can I buy those recipes？，And I literally was selling。。

I don't even want to admit this， but $500。，People were paying for just the recipes。

before the book was out。，And I was like， I was charging a lot for coaching，，like a lot。

 like thousands。，So to me， I was like，，I don't want people to know my recipes。。

That's how I'm making money。，That's what I'm known for。，But I was like。

 I can't keep coaching this much。，And so why not have something， an e-book，。

and you just send it to them？，And that's the way to do it。，And since then。

 I've made like the hard copies and stuff。，But at first， it was just an e-book。。

So what would you say，，how did you advertise your book，and like get it out there？，Like how did you？。

I did everything online， like literally。，I'm doing video after video。，This is how I eat。。

This is a recipe。，I'm showing you recipes from my book，，like my favorites。，And they're like， Greg。

 man， make a cookbook。，And I'm like， all right， you want the book？，I'll make the book。。

But I wasn't going to sell it cheap。，Like they're like， I had a team of people。

working with me at the time。，They're like， yeah， it should be $29。99。，I'm like， $29？。

It's going to be $200。，What do you mean？，I'm selling it for $500 now。，Like just like a。

 what do you call it？，I'm not even technical，，but a copy on the Internet， PDF or whatever。，I'm like。

 here it is， the recipes。，And I was like， it's got to be $200。，And then the whole pandemic hit。。

And then like people are out of work。，I'm like， well， I guess I can't charge。，I'll charge half price。

，It's $99。，And everyone's shitting on me like， oh， my God。，I imagine what they said at $200。。

So just saying like it was available on a video，was like all I needed to do。，I mean， and since then。

 I've got it in Mandarin。，It's being sold in China。，I collabed with Al Dura。。

We have an Arabic cookbook for Egypt。，Like I've made various， like so different languages。

trying to capitalize on other audiences，，other people， other spoken languages。，And so， you know。

 I'm just continuing on right now。，It's really good。，Books have sold well。，Yeah。

 it's really important to diversify in other languages。，I'm about to get my book in Spanish as well。。

So， you know， I see great minds think alike， man。，And your book is big。，It's like 700 pages。。

How many recipes you got in that thing？，Oh， God， it's not even that big。，But yeah。

 getting back to the--，I saw it's still 700 pages。，There's like 200--。

There's about 200 pages in these books。，But when I was coaching Mr。 Beast，。

he had mentioned like you need to start，putting books in different languages。，And he's like。

 even your videos on YouTube，，like if you want to get big，。

and this is advice to anyone if you're on YouTube，，if you get big enough，。

if you really want to get big，，you have to get into other languages。

because how many people speak English？，And so the more languages you can get to--。

So my videos are on Bilibili in China。，China is a big country。，Like there's a lot of people。。

And so you make videos there，，so you're getting millions of views there，，translate to Mandarin，。

and you can get a whole new audience。，Bam。，So you said you coached Mr。 Beast。，Tell us about that。。

Yeah， basically just he had featured me on a video，where I did the Guinness Book of World Record。

for the deadlift，，and he was like，，just freaky things that happened in this year，。

and all of a sudden I'm watching this video，because it's obviously a sub，，and I'm like，，oh。

 there's me on the Mr。 Beast channel。，So I wrote him，，I'm like， hey， thank you。。

for having me on the--，featuring me on your channel or whatever。，And I'm like，。

if you ever want a coach for dieting，，I'm an expert on this stuff。，He's like， oh， really？。

And he's like，，can I give you a call right now？，I'm like， yeah。，And so I'm talking on the phone。。

I'm like， okay。，So I'm going to help you do that。，So he started at 40% body fat。。

He's down to 25% body fat。，Now he has his own coach，living at his house inside。。

He's doing a bodybuilding competition，against a guy in like maybe 9 or 10 months。，I'm like， hey，。

if you want me to help you again，，I'll do it。，I'm like， but he's dieting。。

He wants to get to single-digit body fat。，He's 25% now。，And so there you have it。，Dr。

 Justin Marchegiani: That's awesome， man。，All right。，So I'll hit some of these chats real quick。。

And guys， don't forget to like the video。，Subscribe to the channel。。

Also check out Greg Doucette's YouTube channel as well。，I linked it below and his supplements。。

I put his Instagram， YouTube，，and his supplement website there。。

So we'll run through these real quick。，And guys， from this point forward，。

I'm going to read only 20 and up，，but I'll read these because they came in before。，Cam2Time says，。

1 Corthinians， 11， 3。，But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ。。

And the head of the woman is the man。，And the head of Christ is God。，Well said。，Dr。

 Justin Marchegiani: Cool。，Cam2Time says，，No， he read that again。，Is it another one？，This is the—，Dr。

 Justin Marchegiani: That's above my head。，I know I'm only 5'6"， but that's—，Cam2Time says，，11， 9。

 King James Version says，，For the man is not of the woman，，but the woman is of the man。。

Neither was the man created for the woman，，but the woman for the man。，Dr。 Justin Marchegiani: Okay。。

Alright。，Silent Chaos says，，Hey， Greg， would you recommend TRT for healthy and active 30-year-old man。

who just wants to feel like they're 16 again？，No。，You're too young。，You don't—。

I recommend TRT for people that need TRT，，not just for people that want to feel 16。。

And your testosterone levels at 30，，they're almost the same as 16。，There's no real difference there。。

Dr。 Justin Marchegiani: Bam。，Eat better， my friend， and sleep more。，I don't think people—，Greg。

 can you talk a little bit about the importance of sleep， man？。

I've always said that sleep is like the most anaphylactic that you can do naturally，。

and people don't tend to believe me when I say this。，They look at me like， "Oh， bro。

 I don't need sleep at all。"，Can you talk about that？，You're bang on。。

Sleep is one of the most overrated things that people don't consider。

when they're doing any kind of diet training or anything。，Everyone needs to sleep。。

If you don't get sleep， everything's downhill from there。，Like cortisol's up。。

It's gonna be that much harder。，You're gonna be that much hungrier。，You're not recovered。。

You're overtrained。，And the worst part about dieting is you can't sleep。，When you get leaner。

 the body basically—，It keeps you awake because it wants you to hunter，，be a hunter-gatherer。

 go out there。，Go and kill a deer。，Go eat some blueberries。，Get up。，Just don't lay there and sleep。。

So the leaner you get， the more difficult the time it gets to sleep。，When I was natural。

 I slept 3 to 5 hours a night on average，，and it was a nightmare。，Low sex drive。。

I remember one time I didn't have an orgasm for maybe 2 or 3 months。，Natural。，When I'm natural。

 not on gear， nothing。，I could have had 14 porn stars in front of me。，It would have made no—。

I did not care。，That's the dangers of dieting that hard。，And even on PDs。

 you're on all the tests in the world。，When you're shredded， especially when you're on Tren。

 you can't sleep。，So you have Trensomnia。，You can't recover。，You're always feeling like shit。。

You have no sex drive because you have no energy。，I don't care how much test you're on。。

Test will make you more horny， but not if you have no food。，And so you need sleep。。

I've said it in videos。，People don't believe me。，If I had to choose between a fat burner and a sleeping pill on a diet。

，sleeping pill every single freaking time。，Facts。，Facts。，There you go， guys。。

So now you know I'm not just biased when I say y'all need to sleep more。，Okay， we got Alex here。。

I'd love to give Greg a huge shout-out for his diet info/cookbook。，Started $200 down to $175。，Lean。

 maintainable from his help。，Subbed for several years。，Shout-out to you， Alex。，There you go。。

Happy book buyer right there。，Alex10bucks says， "I'd like to also thank you， Myron。

 and Fresh for all the endless information you provide。，580 to 710 credit score in a couple months。。

Making $100K soon to buy the first property。，Well done， gents。，North Dakota。"，Shout-out to you。

 my friend。，Yeah， this is a collab y'all didn't see coming， but you guys needed。。

Bitcoin Bennett says， "Greg， have you seen the viral video that Tay posted when he came out of jail？。

How does he look like the Hulk after being in jail for three months？"，I haven't seen it。

 but I've heard that he's come out。，People requested， say。

 "You got to do a video on his body out of jail physique。"，And I'm like， "I'm just too busy。"。

So I haven't been on it yet。，I think it's just push-ups， right？，Yeah。

 he's been doing a lot of training in the gym。，Almost take a little sleep。，Literally。

 you only need 30% of the work that you did to get something to keep that。。

And it's not like the guy is training like three hours a day like an animal on gear。。

So why couldn't he go away and keep the same muscle he has？。

It's not like he had a ton to lose in the first place。，Yes， that's 100% true。。

There's a study that came out about that where if you build up a physique to a certain point，。

you can maintain it with only about 30% of the volume with like push-ups and calisthenics fairly well。

 too。，Absolutely。，Just look at the pandemic。，Gyms were closed。，Did everyone lose all their gains？。

I didn't。，Yeah， yeah。，And if your protein is high and you do calisthenics to a degree and work to some level of somewhat。

，not even close to failure， you can maintain。，Michael Meadstroke says， "$1 super sticker。。

Appreciate that。"，And then， "Too near me not to hear me，" goes， "Greg。

 what are your thoughts on natural herbs for boosting testosterone such as Tongkat Ali， Ashwagandha。

 and Shilajit？"，Shilajit。，Okay， so Tongkat Ali， Ali's favorite。，That's an amazing one。。

On Andrew Huberman's podcast， he spoke of Tongkat Ali and Fidogia agrestis increasing test levels。

 100 to 200 nanograms per deciliter each。，Ashwagandha also shown to improve test levels。。

And so these are the big three like Ashwagandha， Tongkat Ali， and Fidogia agrestis。，Shilajit， Jit。

 whatever， I can't pronounce it。，I really don't know much about that one。，I can't comment。。

But certainly those are great for boosting testosterone levels。。

I see no negatives like side effects or anything bad about that。，I'd highly recommend it。，Yeah， nice。

，Chip Osorio goes， "Coach Greg， great to see your collaboration with Fresher Fit。。

How did you come up with the harder than last timeline？"。

I was literally just screaming like on a video and saying like people on video like how hard you should train。

，I'm like harder than last time， like how hard？，Harder than last time and it just kind of just I didn't think of it。

，I was just screaming in front of the camera and was like， "You just need to train harder。"。

I don't know how hard。，I can't quantify it。，I'm not like reps in reserve。，I'm not Mike Izertel。。

I'm not going to be like train 1% off this。，I was like I'll just like go to the freaking gym and push hard。

 train harder than last time。，That hard。，Harder than last time。，It just seems simple。。

I want to ask you about this， Greg， because this is something actually that I notice a lot of the times when I go to the gym and I watch。

 you know， if I look at someone else training or whatever。

 I notice that people just don't go that hard。，They don't try that hard。，They're not sweating。。

They're not pushing sets close to failure。，They're kind of just like chilling。。

Can you talk about the importance of high training intensity to actually build a good physique？。

Absolutely。，So beginners， that's okay。，You don't need to train hard because anything more than you're doing is going to cause your muscles to grow。

，It's about progressive overload。，But if you've been training for a year or two and you're not training near failure。

 then how are you expecting to grow？，And so if you look in the gym， and this is my general rule。

 if you're going to the gym and you see more than one person in the gym training harder than you。

 you're not training hard enough。，Unless you're a beginner。，Unless you just started。。

Then you can just kind of like go through the motions you're going to gain。，So when I go to the gym。

 even on a bad day， a day I walk out， I'm like， man， I didn't push myself。。

I didn't have it in me mentally。，I'm still training harder than almost everyone in the gym。。

So that's my main thing。，I'm like most people， they're worried about reps and reserve reps between sets。

 sets， form， technique， all this。，I'm like， if you just go to the gym and train harder than last time。

 you're going to get way more gains than the perfect diet， the perfect training program。

 the perfect everything。，Just go and freaking push and you're going to get the results。，Yeah。。

I always say consistency and effort over time overrides optimality。，So absolutely。，So yeah。

 absolutely。，OK。 We got here。 Uno goes。，Are I Argentine？，Yeah。

 Argentine supplements a good choice to increase tests。，I also heard it has other health benefits。

 including reducing cholesterol。，To increase tests？ No。，I mean， it's like even test boosters of old。

 like the best test booster from 5， 10 years ago， almost like essentially useless。。

It's only the newest stuff that's working。，So no， it's not going to make a big difference。。

Not at all。，Fit John John says Natty for life。，OK。，Mitchoka goes or Mitchaka。。

What's your opinion on pre workouts？，I use them every time I work out or do a bike ride。，Is caffeine。

 black coffee a good， I want to say， replacement for pre workout？，Absolutely。。

Caffeine is probably the most studied performance enhancing drug。，It was a drug。。

It was banned in the Olympics。，You could fail for if you had too much caffeine in your system。。

They made it legal after around 20 years ago。，I know one person that failed the drug test for caffeine and they just said。

，Whatever it's caffeine。，But yeah， you couldn't take it。。

But between one and three milligrams per kilogram of body weight， that's shown where you should be。。

One to start and then up to about three。，So I'm about close to 90 kilos。。

So 270 milligrams is a good dose of caffeine for me。。

Significant improvements in cardiovascular ability， effort， strength， all that。，It's a no brainer。。

Everyone I think is well， not everyone's on caffeine， but almost everyone。，I mean。

 it's a great supplement for sure。，OK。，Marley， when you stop TRT and your erection and libido drop off。

 does it come back eventually？，Or am I stuck on TRT for the rest of my life to maintain a healthy sex life？

，Once you're on TRT， it's supposed to be for the rest of your life。，Now mind you， if you stop。。

So for example， I'm on TRT， 140 milligrams。，And I did stop for a period of nine weeks。。

My sports doctor said， let's try this and see what happens。。

My testosterone levels were below that of a female， like an average female。。

And I still was able to have sex， but I only wanted it like once a week。。

But the problem is it takes a lot of time for your body to get back to normal。。

It can take months and/or years。，And so you have to be able to—willing to wait that time period。

 which could be—let's say it's a year。，And so are most people going to be willing to wait a year before they can feel good again？

，And so it's tough。，Like you can get it back to normal， but not everyone。，And so my advice。

 once you start TRT， it is for the rest of your life。，But you can get off。

 but you got to be willing to have that suffering between the time that you stop taking it and when your body gets back to normal。

，Oftentimes it can be a year or more。，Damn， so what if you have a girlfriend or wife？。

They're screwed for a year or two。，It's a good thing because she doesn't want it。，And she's like。

 thank God you're off of that stuff。，And， you know， by the way， guys。

 what we're going to do is we're going to kill the Facebook stream， Twitch， and Twitter。。

So come on over to YouTube， guys。，Come on over to YouTube， YouTube Fresh and Fit。，And then also。

 guys， go subscribe to Greg Doucette's YouTube channel as well。，Link is below。 Check him out。，OK。

 so we'll continue back on with the chats。，We got here， Gustavo Mouratala says， "Hey， Fresh and Fit。

 y'all know what's the difference between creatine HCL and creatine monohydrate？

 Pros and cons for both。"，There's no benefit to any kind of creatine。。

Creatine monohydrate is cheaper in general。，There's no benefit to any other kind。。

Get the one you want。，The cheaper， the better。，In general。

 there's absolutely no benefit to switching to a different kind。，Yeah， monohydrate is the cheapest。。

Fit John John， "Greg， will you bring back you rating your subscriber physique？"，Absolutely。

 I've not done that。，I just don't want to do it all the time。，I don't want to make it too old。。

We got here， Lord says， "What are your thoughts on 25-year-old taking TRT？"，What the fuck？。

If they need it， absolutely。，I've literally coached people on TRT and younger than that。。

Some people are just born with a genetic condition。，They don't produce proper levels of testosterone。

，I've seen it a number of times。，Oftentimes， though， it's usually people who are anorexic。。

And they might not even know they're anorexic。，You just think they're a skinny guy。

 but they're like starving and secret，because males don't kind of admit that kind of a thing。。

It's more seen as something women do。，But oftentimes。

 I've coached several and I've done phone consults，，guys who are like 100， 120 pounds。

 and they're shredded at six-pack，，but they're not eating anything。。

They're eating like a thousand calories a day。，Their testosterone levels are tanked。

 and they can't get it back，，and they have to go on HRT。，Damn。，Okay。，Greg。

 how important is it to get your T levels checked as a guy？，I wouldn't say it's extremely important。。

Maybe 3% of guys is probably going to be too low as a young age。。

But the beauty of if you do get it done is you have that baseline，because it's normal。，Essentially。

 people want to be somewhere between 250，and maybe a thousand nanograms per deciliter。。

Just because you're low， it doesn't mean it's bad。，If you come up with 400。

 but you've always been 400，，well， there's nothing wrong with that if you feel good。。

But on the other extent， if you were 800 your whole life，，and now it's 400， you could feel horrible。。

But the guy is 400， and he's at 400 still。，He feels amazing。。

So that's the beauty of having your test levels checked。，You don't need to， but generally，。

if you don't feel good and there's something off， then get it checked。。

But I wouldn't say every 20-year-old needs to go to their doctor，and say。

 "I need my test levels checked。"，Because why？，I'd rather see them check their blood pressure。。

That's a much bigger indicator of a problem。，High blood pressure at a young age，。

you'd lead to heart attacks and strokes and so on。，If we're going to get one thing tested。

 it's your blood pressure。，Okay。 Yeah。 All right。，And then we got here， Big Player JD goes，。

"I was 320 pounds， age of 32。，I did 2 hours cardio 2 times a day。，I did 1。

000 abs and full body workouts。，7 months later， at 33 years old， I'm 190 pounds。，Thank you， guys。"。

Hey， man。 That's what it's about， my friend。，That's incredible。，Awesome。。

It reminds me of Ethan Suplee。，He was riding 6 hours a day on a bicycle for like 8 months。。

He went from like 500-some pounds to like 250。，Oh， nice。，Damn。。

I'm starting a job wildland firefighting。，It's pretty strenuous work。。

They recommend a low-protein diet due to organ stress。。

Would your peri-light help me not lose too much muscle，，or should I not worry about losing muscle？。

Well， a low-protein diet， I wouldn't do that at all。，I think that's ridiculous。，I mean。

 at least consume half a gram per protein，a pound of body weight。，I mean， 1 gram may be optimal， 0。8。

 anywhere on that。，But like I wouldn't try to avoid protein。，But would peri-light help？，Absolutely。。

There's 8 grams of protein per serving。，So if you're not having enough protein。

and you're taking peri-light，，it has 8 grams of essential amino acids and BCAs。。

So it would help you not lose muscle，，same as protein powder。。

But if they're saying don't take protein，and you're taking peri-light，，you're getting protein。。

So you'd be kind of going against the purpose。，Yeah， man。，You guys， I don't think you understand。。

Protein is imperative，if your goal is to build an aesthetic physique， man。，Well。

 1 gram per pound of body weight，is what people generally say you can go，，you know。

 1 gram per pound of lean body mass，，but you definitely need adequate protein。

to maintain a muscular physique。，Gregg says–，Was that–，Yeah， Moe。

 these came in after the fact or what？，They were before。，They were before？ Okay。，Great。。

I'm gonna ask this question，and then we're gonna get back into the pod。。

How has the hair transplant been treating you？，#cookbook，Bam！ Look at that。，I did a hair transplant。

 too。，It seems all right。，I've had a lot of people make videos，saying it went horrible。，Oh， my God。。

They botched it。，I'm like， I don't know。，I think it looks–，I ate it。，It could be better maybe，。

but like it's not horrible。，How did you do yours？，Did you go to Turkey and do it？，Turkey。。

Did you do it with–，I had a transplant from–to here。。

Like they just unplug stuff and plug them back in。，I had put here and in the front。，And I don't know。

，They said you're not supposed to do cardio for a month。，I'm like， are you kidding？。

I took like two days off，and I was freaking bike racing after that。，I was like。

 I'm not taking time off。，And so I didn't even listen to what they said。。

I think it looked pretty good， you know。，So 'cause I did a hair transplant as well。。

I did it here in the States，，so I didn't want to go all the way to Turkey。，Did they cut your head。

or did they just pluck it from the–，No， I was like， one of my friends did that。，I'm like， oh， my God。

 a scar，and a whole take the skin。，No， they just–，I don't know what it's called。。

They just pluck out hair，and they re-plug it in。，And I only went 'cause like honestly，。

my girlfriend had Crohn's disease。，She lost 30% of her hair。。

She had like two feet of her bowels removed，，like serious–，like she was 100 pounds。。

She's like 150 now almost or whatever。，So she was like， you know，，she couldn't absorb food。。

So a lot of her hair fell out。，And so we wanted to go there to help her。，I'm like， yeah。

 I'll go with you。，And then she got rejected，because her hair wasn't strong enough per se。。

And I'm like， well， we're here。，I'm gonna do it。，So I didn't really care about my hair that much。。

I wasn't like I had no hair。，And I was like， you know，，it may as well， what the hell，。

I'll do it with you，because we're both gonna go bald。，And so I was like，。

I'll be bald with my girlfriend， whatever。，And people were like，，oh。

 Greg cares so much about his hair。，I'm like， I don't care。，If you look at my old videos，。

did you see my hair？，I look like Kramer。，I was like， I didn't care。。

How long ago did you do your transplant？，It was a year and a couple months ago，。

like December of like a year or so，，whatever， I don't know，，a year and a half ago。。

Let's say a year is when you're fully recovered。，So I mean， it looks good， bro。，Looks fantastic。。

I mean， you both look good。，No homo。，I mean， for me， I'm still not done。，I still got some more。。

For me， 47。，I'm like， I don't know。，It's not too bad。，For abusing steroids for 10 years，。

my hair was doing pretty good，，I would have to say。，Yeah。，Oh， man。，All right。，What else we got here？。

OK， Christopher Peterson goes，，been working out religiously，for the last four months。。

My heart's full。，How many times should I work out，each major muscle group each week？，Two for sure。。

Agreed。，Frequency is definitely your friend in that case。，Can I skip leg day？，It depends。。

Are you racing bikes？，If you're racing bikes like me，，you can skip leg day every way。。

I'm sprinting on my bike，，getting up off the saddle。，Every day is leg day for me。。

If I'm not in the gym，，I'm racing on my bike。，My legs are always gone。，Like， it's tough。。

I'm just running from the holes， bro。，Ask Greg if he'll collaborate with me。，Hey， bro。

 you got to hit him up on the side， OK？，We'll see。，And then Dad does 20 bucks。。

Nearly killed myself over here，ago， got out of my head。，Started watching FNF， Coach Greg and others。。

Lost over 100 pounds。，More to go。，Keep it up， guys。，Love your content。，Thank you so much。，So， Greg。

 transitioning real quick。，So me and you both have made，pretty much the TikTok Hall of Fame。

of getting kicked off。，Can you tell us about getting canceled on TikTok？，Multiple times canceled。。

And so my TikTok channel doing really well。，I don't know how many followers I had。。

A hundred and something thousand。，I didn't even post it。，I had people。，I'm like。

 take the videos I'm putting here，and post them here。，So I'm like， it was like a no-brainer。。

I'm like， you know， expand。，So I do this one video on this guy，who's being made fun of for this girl。

for talking to her at the gas station。，Basically， he walks up to her and is like，，Hey。

 you're attractive。，Can I have your phone number， whatever？，And she gets out of that scene。。

She's like， imagine this guy has the nerve，to come and talk to me at the gas station。，I'm too busy。。

I don't want to get hit on。，I got this。，And I'm like， who do you think you are？。

Just because you're young and you're 20。，Beautiful girl and blonde。。

And the people hated that video so much。，I had 58，000 not likes or views。，Negative comments。，58，000。。

And I'm reading like，，you're the biggest asshole predator in the world。，I'm like。

 I'm just defending a guy，talking to a girl at the gas station。。

When my girlfriend fills up the Lambo，at the gas station， people are like，，Wow， nice car。，Oh。

 my goodness。，They're nice。，Do you think she's like， you creepo？，And they come home。

 make a video saying，，How dare you talk to me？，Don't you know I'm a girl？，Like， what？。

I just don't understand it。，I'm like， when I was，，I mean， I'm old。，I'm 47。，When I was young，。

you could actually approach women，and talk to them and say，，Hi， I find you attractive。。

I like your shoes， your shirt， whatever。，Can I have your phone number？，Let's go for coffee。。

Now you can't talk to anyone。，Why do you think women behave this way， Greg？。

Where they're being so rude and abrasive，to men that just might，just want to start a conversation？。

I think people overvalue themselves。，I think they think，they're better than they are。。

I think that everyone's looking for that，5 or 10 or 15 minutes of fame，，like， oh， my God， look at me。

，This happened to me。，And so they do their little TikTok thing。，And they're like，，Well。

 if I make this video，and say this， whatever， creep，，because he's not a 9 on 10，。

he's not Chris Bumstead，talking to me at the gas station，，then everyone's going to agree with me。

and make me feel pretty，and good about myself。，So I think people just do it for views，，for clicks。

 likes， attention。，Yeah。，And I want to say this， too。，What are your thoughts，on all these thotties。

in the gym recording themselves，，right， where they're saying，，oh， this guy's staring at me，，blah。

 blah， blah。，He's a creep。，Shout to Joey Swole。，He's putting these hoes in check， man，。

and letting them know，that they're ridiculous。，What are your thoughts on that， man？，I mean， to me，。

that's equivalent to the gas station。，They're making videos，of people approaching them。

 talking to them。，Everyone wants to think，that they're so this or that。，And it's like。

 if I'm looking at you，，how do you know，I'm not just trying to learn from you？，How do you know。

I'm not just， like， turning my head over？，Like， what makes you think，that you're so special。

and so interesting，that I have to look at you right now？。

And I think people just want to be the victim。，People play that victim card。，It's just like。

 woe is me。，I'm a victim。，Cancel culture。，It's horrible。，I think it's ridiculous。，I can't believe。

these people are doing it。，But at least with the gyms，，I think most women as well，are like， yeah。

 that's silly。，Like， most of the women I talk to，，they're like， no， it shouldn't be like that。。

And I want to say this， too，，because my thing is， right，，and I talk about this in my book，。

Why Women Deserve Less。，I talk about how social media，has negatively impacted women， right，。

and it's made them kind of have，an overinflated sense of self-worth。，And， you know。

 we live in a clout era。，You know， if it's putting down，a guy in the gym，or putting down a guy。

that makes an approach at you，at the gas station， right，，to go ahead and make themselves feel better。

or try to get views or whatever。，And， you know， you keep referring，，saying that you're old， etc。。

You know， 20 years ago，，were things like this，back when you were in your mid-20s？。

Nothing was like this。，Like， it's so different。，I'm like， I wonder if。

every generation feels this bad。，Like， because， like， my parents，would have thought it was。，I'm like。

 am I that old，that I don't understand，the next generation？，Because it must be that。

because I personally don't get it。，When I was younger，，you would go and talk to somebody。。

You would speak in person。，You didn't swipe left or right，or up and down or make a circle。。

You actually said，，"Hi， my name is such and such。，I think this，，we should go out sometime。"。

Now you can't talk to people。，Like， I used to go and date people，at the gym all the time。，I'm like。

 "Hi， this is。。。"，Like， to me， the gym was like the bar，because I was like，。

these are women with the same interest in me。，They have the physique that I like。。

They have the same interests。，I would date girls in the gym。，That's what I did。，I'd say， "Hi。

 you're working out。，You look good。 Let's go out。"，That was it。 It was that simple。。

Now you can't do that。，I would never go，，"I have a girlfriend。"，But if I was， how could you do that？。

And to me， at least me， I'd be like，，"Hey， do you watch Coach Greg？，That's me。 You want to talk？"。

Like， you would at least have a chance。，But， like， the average person，that's like a 5 on 10。

 good-looking guy，，like， 5'6"， oh， geez， you have no chance。，Like， what would you do now？，Like。

 I don't know how people do it。，I don't know how people date now。，Like， I don't know how--。

literally how people do it。，Yeah， it's pretty bad， man。，The average guy is basically invisible。

to the average girl， you know？，And I talk about this extensively。

how women's standards have kind of went up，thanks to social media。

and they have an overinflated sense of self-worth。，I mean， you know。

 the fact that you're even saying，，like， yeah， back in the day，。

I could have been able to go up to a girl，and talk to her in the gym。

and strike up and get a date going。，We actually tell guys，don't head on girls at the gym，because。

 well， nowadays，，they might record you on TikTok。，And then number two，，a lot of the times。

 it's just an L， you know what I mean？，It's a very low rate of success，unless you're， like。

 an extremely attractive guy。，You go about it a certain way，，but it's almost like a strategy。

if you're going to talk to girls in the gym nowadays。，Even 20 years ago， I said，。

I'm going to just do an experiment。，I'm going to go up to 10 girls today。

and I'm going to ask all of them for their number，and I'm going to see what percentage I got。。

I got 5， so I had 50-50。，Half the girls I wanted to go out with，，I could go out with。，Now。

 I would never dare do that，unless I had a camera，and I was like， it's a skit I'm doing。，That way。

 I could say I'm just an actor。，But I would never dare do that。，You know what I mean？。

It's gone crazy。，It's funny you said it，because a lot of pranksters，。

that's the way we're talking to girls。，They'll do a prank video。，They'll have a phone number。。

They'll be like， "Oh， I got it。"，But it's a prank。，Oh， wait， hold on。 It's a prank。。

Don't get mad at me。，But， Greg， I want to ask you this， Greg。，Personally speaking，，if you're a guy。

 right，，not that tall， you're pretty short，，let's say 5'6"， to be exact。。

How important is it to work out in the gym？，I think the better you look，，the more in shape you are，。

the better your chances。，I mean， absolutely。，I mean， we know that women， on average，。

we've asked them，，what body fat percentage do you like？，Mostly 10% to 15%。。

And so if you're 30% and you get down to 15%，，your chances are going up without question。，Now。

 of course， there's someone for everyone。，Not everyone wants a lean guy， 10% to 15%。。

But more want that than not。，And so you're increasing your odds。，But what else could you do？。

You could get a job。，You could have money。，You could work on your personality。。

You could work on your social skills。，You could be yourself，because most people，。

they want to pretend they're something，they're not to get or attract a girl。，I'm like。

 how is that good？，Then they're falling in love，with somebody that you're not，。

and that's going to last， what， 6 months？，And then you're going to be yourself，。

and then no one's going to like each other。，So just be yourself， be open，，have confidence。

 and just try。，But the problem is， people don't dare try，because they're scared to get shut down。。

It used to be the number one fear of men，is rejection。，Now it's like the number one fear。

is being rejected and then made fun of，on videos with it。，Yeah， it's really bad。，Do you think， Greg，。

in your opinion，，do you think that there's an attack，on masculinity。

with all this bullshit that's going on？，Absolutely。，You can't be a man anymore。，There's no way。。

You cannot--，Well， you can try。，If you're a 10 on 10，，you can get away with it。。

If you're Chris Bumstead，，you can act a certain way。，But if you're an average guy，，you can't dare。。

You have to pretend。，What people do is they say what people think，that they want them to say。。

So they just go and what the majority--，If 51% of people think a certain way，。

that's what everyone is trying to act like。，That's what they'll say，because they're too scared。

to get canceled or be in the minority。，It's kind of like when you're a kid。

and people would make fun of other people。，It's sad， but they're bullying。。

People laugh or make fun of，the least attractive kid，or the whatever， the nerd， whatever。。

And it's because you don't want to be，the one being made fun of，。

so you just go along with the majority。，And so that's what's happening now。。

People are going along with the majority。，They're scared to be themselves。。

They're scared to say what they actually think，because they're afraid of being canceled。，Damn。。

That's a good take， bro。，Yeah， and the thing I like about you a lot， Greg，。

is that you give commentary。，You're a fitness influencer，，but you give commentary。

on contemporary events as well。，And you talk about other things，。

and you're not afraid to go against the grain。，And I'll be honest with you。。

A lot of guys in the fitness industry are pussies。，They're scared to say what's on their mind。

because they don't want to lose supplement deals。，They don't want to really say，what's on their mind。

，Can you speak to that a little bit？，What makes you--，Why did you say， "Fuck it。。

I'm going to say what I want。，I don't care what people think"？，You say。

 "Why do I not care what people think？"，Literally， as I was growing up。

and becoming a teenager and so on，，I was worried about，what do people think of me。

and what do people this and that？，And I'm like--，The first time I just started saying，。

"What if I just stop giving a shit，about what people think，and I just be myself？"。

And it was liberating。，It was like， "Wow。，I just don't have to care。"，Like， "So what？

 They don't like me。，I'll find someone else who does。"，And so I'm making YouTube videos，。

and I'm saying everything I want。，I'm like， "Okay。，There's 100，000 people，that are going to hate me，。

but there's going to be，100，000 people that like me。，I'll just focus on the good。。

You guys can all shit on me，in one ear， out the next。，You guys say something nice。。

I'm going to take that in。"，And so it's so much better，because why pretend。

and be something you're not，and have people like you，when it's not the real you？。

And that's what people do。，They do it all the time。，And there's so many YouTubers--，like。

 people I've collaborated with，，for example--，and they have one persona online，，and it's like。

 "They're this。"，And then behind the scenes，，oh， my God，，they're nothing like that。。

And so they have--，To me， they're just actors。，The easiest way to act，is to be yourself。，Like。

 when you make a video，，I might scream and shout，a little bit more，，but it's who I am。。

And so if you're pretending，to be whatever you're not，，you don't believe it，，like， how is that fun？。

How long can you do that for？，Not for very long。，And again， that's one thing，I really like about you。

 man，，is because a lot of people，in the fitness industry are very scared。，They watch what they say，。

and it's kind of annoying，because it's like you don't feel，like you're getting the real person。

when you watch their videos。，Like， they're trying to， you know，，identify in a certain manner。

so that they don't lose sponsorships，，they don't trigger the wrong people，，whatever it may be。。

They don't say what's on their mind。，Which， speaking of which，，perfect transition to this topic。。

So you have a background，in powerlifting。，What are your thoughts，on what the hell's going on here。

with these guys that are，entering in as women，and completely demolishing women。

in powerlifting events？，So it's absolutely embarrassing。，Even the Canadian Center。

for Ethics in Sports，，they literally think that，there's no advantage to being born a male。

over being born a female。，And they'll quote different studies，，and they'll say， "No。

 it's more the training，and their diet and the coaching，that has to be like，，are you an idiot？。

Men on average，are 5 inches taller than women。，They have stronger bones，，larger bones。。

They have testosterone levels，10 to 12 times higher than female。，I don't care if you transition。

as you're older，and you have lower test levels。，You have the advantage，of being born a male。。

For that long，，you're a bigger frame。，And so， of course， you can be better。，And so， of course，。

if you identify as a woman，and you're a man，，you're going to have a huge advantage。

that makes it not fair。，The reason there are female sports，in the first place。

is because it's not fair，to have them compete against men。，Sure， there's one or two girls。

out of a thousand that could do it，，but in general，，we want more participation in sports。。

Like I was a phys ed teacher。，The more people that play， the better。。

There should be so many different categories。，We have junior， teenage， open， masters，，veteran。

 seniors， whatever，，all these different categories，to involve and encourage。

more people to participate。，So why don't we just have，the trans category，that's their own division，。

and then we're encouraging them。，We recognize their right to say，，"Okay， identify as a woman。，Great。。

Wear whatever you want。，Dress as a female。，I don't care if people wear panthers。

and identify as a child。，I don't care。"，But have your own category。，Don't make it unfair。

for someone else to take their spot away，in the Olympics or whatever。，That's just wrong。，Yeah。，Greg。

 for a prime minister，，I agree with you， man，，because the thing is that。

it's funny because these leftists，and these feminists and these libs，。

they vote for this type of legislation，to allow these individuals，to participate in their sports，。

but the people that lose，at the end of the day are the women。，They're the ones that take the Ls。。

They're the ones that lose the scholarships。，They're the ones that can't compete。

because I've said it before。，I'll say it again。，Women get mad at me on the podcast，when I say this。。

Men are physically superior to women，in almost every way。，More bone--，Stronger bone density，。

more-- denser muscles，，more lung capacity。，We're just stronger than them，，taller than them，。

like you said， on average 5 inches。，Like， we just beat them in every regard，，so they can't compete。

 right？，So there's a reason，why we got two different leagues，，but when you want to go ahead。

and combine it， like， yeah，，guys are going to go ahead，and compete in the female sections。

and absolutely destroy them。，This happened in the NCAA。，I think some guy was ranked。

like 500th for swimming。，The swimmer。，Yeah。，And it starts setting records as a woman。。

It's like it's happening，cycling， weightlifting。，Yeah， it kills them，，like first place smoking them。

 dude。，So you take a mediocre male，，he identifies as a woman。，Now he destroys these females，。

and they're the ones，that are taking the Ls。，And I agree with you。，Here's the thing。。

Even though I laugh at female sports，and I think that it's a big waste of time。

and no one should watch it，，I still think that it needs a place， right？，Because--。

And the reason why I say that--，The reason why I say that，is because I think women need sports。

because it keeps them away，from doing stupid things。，If I do have a daughter one day，。

I'm going to put her in every sport，and keep her preoccupied，because I always say。

I don't have to do the devil's work。，And women in sports， right，，like high school， etc。，。

keeps them from doing stupid ho shit。，So not all the time，，but most of the time。。

Until they get to college。，Until they get to college。，No， it's funny。，I have the opposite view。。

Probably because I was a phys ed teacher。，Like for females to play in sports，。

I think that it's the best。，Like I think it's awesome。，I agree。，More people play in sports。

 the better。，So should they have female or male sports？，Of course they should。。

You know what I'm like？，Of course they should。，Like that's something，that we're 100% disagree with。。

No， no， no。，I agree that they should be playing sports。，I'm just saying I laugh at people。

that watch professional female sports。，Well， for example，，you'd rather watch male tennis。

than female tennis or female golf。，It depends on the sport。，Sometimes people will be like，，well。

 in male tennis，，they're so powerful in the serves。，It's over so quick。，Women in sports。

 they rally longer。，So some people argue it's more interesting。，So I don't know。。

I think it's great to have both。，I'm not going to say，that you should only have one on TV。。

It's like the audience is dictating，what should be shown。，Obviously male sports。

overall much more popular。，If it wasn't， then， well， the NBA，。

the males will be paid less than the women。，But it's not like that。，The money that's being paid。

is going to reflect the eyeballs。，And so if there's more advertisers，on women's sports，。

then they're going to pay them more。，Yeah。，I mean， there are some sports。

that people do prefer to watch。，Women like tennis is an example。，I know a decent amount of guys。

watch female MMA。，I watch MMA a lot。，The women's events are quite exciting。。

They just don't end the fights as quick。，So that's the only negative。，That's for real here， though。

 man。，We watch no damn women's sports。，Yeah， I watch no women's sports。，Again， I think women should。

definitely be able to play sports。，And I think it's good for them，。

especially when they're growing up，and especially in those years，where bad things can happen。。

But yeah， I mean，，I laugh at female sports in general。，But hey， we could agree to disagree， right？。

But no， I definitely think，that women should have the same opportunities。。

And I think it's ridiculous，when you got basically men coming in，and demolishing them。。

I don't think that's fair。，They need to keep the gender separate。，So go ahead。。

You have something else？，No， no。，And then， OK， so powerlifting。，And then are there guys competing？。

Do you foresee that there's going to be guys，competing in female bodybuilding in the future。

if they keep going with the strength？，There's already been a guy，competing in female bodybuilding。。

It's already happened。，It was about a year or two ago。，I forget the event or the contest，。

but I've already seen it happen。，And it didn't look that good。，What's her name？ I mean， his name。。

I can't remember。，I can't remember my own name half the time。，But ask me a name。，Oh， my God。，Yeah。

 it's definitely happened。，Damn， I didn't know。，Damn， it's really going into that。，Wow。。

How do you even like，，how do you even judge that？，Shout out to Zuby。，Yeah， I guess。 Holy shit。，Damn。。

All right， we'll hit some of these chats real quick。，OK， so we got here。，The X Factor says，。

"Mad props to F and F for getting Coach Greg on the show。，Coach Greg，。

if one wants to get into men's physique，，what steps should one take？，Do I need a coach or mentor，。

or is this something that I can figure on my own？"，It's way easier with a coach。

because if you don't have a coach，，you're not going to know how many calories to eat，。

how fast to diet，，how lean you need to get。，You're not going to know how to pose properly。，Obviously。

 you can do it on your own without one，，but oh， my goodness，，it's so much better with a coach。。

I'd strongly recommend you get a coach，who's worked with men's physique competitors before。。

You can do it on your own，，but I wouldn't advise it。，It's a learning curve， bro。，Bro。

 if Ronnie Coleman，，Jay Cutler，，you know what I mean，，and all the top Olympia winners。

all had coaches，，what makes you think that you're not going to need one？，Like， bro。

 having a coach is imperative，if you're going to compete at a higher level。，You just need it。。

Doing it by yourself is almost impossible， bro。，Yeah， dude。。

I would argue you need it more as a beginner，when you first start。，Like， people are like，，"Oh。

 I'll wing it as I'm a--，but as I'm at the Mr。 Olympia，，I'll need a coach。"，I'm like， "No。

 you need to learn how to start。"，And then once you're， like，，really good and know stuff，，like。

 I can coach myself， obviously。，But my first show， looking back，，I didn't know what I was doing。。

I was eating pasta， no protein。，I didn't know that protein built muscle。，I'm a kid in high school。。

So I was eating plain pasta。，I'm like， "I'll cut out the hamburger。，That's more calories。"。

And I was eating muffins，because I thought muffins were healthy。。

So I was eating muffins and plain pasta and dieting，，and I didn't know what I was doing。，I was like。

 "Horrible。"，Let me ask you this， Greg。，Let's say you had a show one year from now。。

What steps would you take right here， right now，to prepare for that show？。

I would start taking steroids tonight。，OK。，And then--，100%， that's what I would need。。

I would get on gear as soon as possible。，That's what niggas do。，That's what niggas do。。

That's what niggas do。，So， and then what would you do as--，Would you hire a coach？。

What would be the prep？，I'm talking about me。，I would just start working out。。

I would start bike racing all the time，because I literally--，I only train 3 days a week。。

I would start training 6 days a week like I used to，，stop bike racing， get on gear，。

and put on whatever amount of muscle I can，in the year coming up。，Would you--。

So what would your cycle be？，And then how would you train？，You said 6 times a week。。

Would you be doing like one body part per day？，Would you be doing push-pull legs？。

I would do a 3-day split for sure。，Do it twice a week。，I would just--。

I would do 10 to 20 sets per muscle group per week。，But in general， just I'd follow my own plan。。

And as far as what I would take，，I would basically start on the lowest dose。

that I could build muscle on。，Probably start at like 400 milligrams of test。。

And then over the course of every month，，I would just go higher and higher and higher。

all the way up to the year。，But that's assuming I want to like win，，like I don't know。

 it's for $100 million，and I need to be at my best。，I would recommend somebody，does a year cycle。

 cycling up。，But if I want to look my best in that much time，，I'm just going to start on a low cycle。

and keep building up over time。，Fair enough。，So you just do-- just TRT， nothing else？，No training？。

I'm on 140 milligrams of test a week right now。，Like I do 100 milligrams a week。。

I just got my blood work back，and the doctor was like，，I've never seen blood work this good。。

Like it was so good that I was like，，man， I should just up my dose。。

Like my doctor's prescription says，120 milligrams every 5 days，，but I only do 100。，And I'm like。

 I always preach，，the lowest dose that makes you happy。，And so I'm like，，well。

 why should I take the most I can，if I don't need it？，And so my test levels are only in the 700s，。

nanograms per deciliter，，so I could definitely go higher。，But I would add in tests。。

I would do like probably 400 milligrams。，Actually， no， I'd probably do like 200 tests。

and 200 mastodon or primo，because I'd like to have that leaner， dry look，，less estrogen conversion，。

and I would slowly go from there。，So the one drug I miss the most is Anuvar。。

I haven't taken Anuvar for whatever years。，It's an oral。，It's just the pumps I used to get on it。。

I love that。，So like the--，Like I've done steroids for like 10 years，。

so I haven't done them for so long，，but it's not like I don't miss it。。

And so although I'm not doing it，，I miss having that strength，，that size， that pump。。

And so regardless of， you know，，how old you are，，I don't think you ever like lose that urge。。

That's why I caution people。，Like once you start， it's hard to stop。，Like I stopped，。

but I was able to transition into bike racing。，So rather than focusing on how I look and my physique。

and being like a world record power lifter，，because I'm weak now。，Like I go against these kids。

and like 25-year-olds or whatever，，teenagers， they lift me in the gym。。

And I'm like I'm a record holder，and these guys are beating me。，That's hard on the head，。

but rather than， you know，，caring about how much I lift or how I look，。

I'm more like how am I doing on a bike。，So that makes it a lot easier。，So I can get by with just HRT。

，But I mean， without HRT，，I'd probably be 10 pounds smaller even still。，- Bam。，- So you're 5'6" now。。

You said you're 5'6"，and what are you weighing nowadays？，- I'm about 8。5% body fat。。

I was 188 this morning。，I actually weighed myself before this。，I was 192。6。。

So like I fluctuate somewhere，in the like upper 180s， low 190s。，- Okay。。

So you blew up with the natty or not stuff， right？，And you， you know，。

obviously from your training experience，，your background，。

you have a very good eye for people that are not natty。，Can you tell us how that series started。

and how you got into it？，- I was just like the rock。，Why do people think he's natural？。

I'm like going down。，People are like he's natural。，I remember I was sitting in a hot tub。

and it was this group of teenagers，and Jay Cutler was in town。，I forget where。，And they're like，。

do you think that Jay Cutler is not natural？，I'm like， like， is that a joke？，Like， they're like，。

because he was in the Mr。 Olympia。，I was like， I was like，，no one in the Mr。 Olympia is natural。。

So I'm like， people just don't know this。，So I made a video，，the rock and Mark Wahlberg。。

I said they're not natural。，I showed the guy，，the rock had had gyno surgery。，I had gynecomastia。

from when he was wrestling days，and in the surgery。，I'm like， these guys are not natural。。

I just sat in the kitchen，and I just ranted。，That video got like， I don't know，，a million。

 two million views or whatever。，And I'm like， holy shit，，everyone's watching this。。

And then so I said，，well， I'm going to do another one，on another person that's famous。，So I said。

 doing that，，I noticed every time I talk about，somebody really famous，and give my opinion on them，。

it gets a lot of views。，And so I started going through the Internet。，Who are popular people？。

I'm going to talk about them。，And so that really helped，blow up my channel。，Aside from doing videos，。

like educational videos，，like the dangers of drugs， steroids，，like the pros and cons，。

the Natty or Notch really took off。，And it was talking about people，who were like really famous。。

That really brought the eyes to my channel。，And I know the same thing，for Derek as well。。

He started doing a lot of the same videos。，Me and Derek were kind of like。

growing together quite frequently。，We did very similar content。，And so it really worked。，And Greg。

 I got to know， brother。，This is a bit on my mind for a minute， right？，Is Liver King natural or not？。

Imagine thinking。，I don't understand how 5% of people，actually thought he was natural。，I'm like。

 how do you guys think this？，But like， I mean， even now，，I don't think the guy is natural now。。

He said he's on like day 50。，I made a video on him。，He said he was naturally。，He's like。

 I've been natural now for 50 days。，And I'm like， but dude， you got leaner。，And he's like。

 here's my all time PR for strength。，I'm like， so what you're telling me。

is you got off all those drugs。，You're natural for 50 days。，And you got leaner and stronger。。

So what is it？，The drugs didn't work。，So by getting off the gear， you improve。，It doesn't make sense。

，Like imagine if I just suddenly grew bigger。，And I'm like， oh， yeah， the secret is。

I just stopped HRT。，Like， no。，But people believe it。，It's just absolutely embarrassing。，Yeah。

 clown world， man。，Absolute clown world。，So what are the biggest indicators，that someone is enhanced？

，What are things that for you，，like， you know， obviously you have a trained eye。。

If someone was brand new，and doesn't know how to identify this，，what things should they look for？。

So the problem is the biggest indicator，is looking at how quickly they put on muscle。。

So without seeing a before and after，，it's almost impossible，unless they look so frigging amazing。

that it's obvious。，Like if you just see a guy，and he's just shredded，and he has acne everywhere。

and he's puffy，and he's got a swollen face，and just like if they're just，like if the guy is huge，。

he's probably not natural。，If the guy looks like he's not natural，，he's probably not natural。。

In general， you're going to be right，most of the time。，Like if I got pocket aces，，I'm going all in。。

Most of the time， I'm right。，So if you look at someone and say，，wow， that's an amazing physique。

and say， I bet he's not natural，，you're going to bet right most of the time。。

So that makes it really simple。，But without seeing the before and after，，very difficult。

because oftentimes a guy can look like shit，and is not natural。，But if you show me a guy，and he's。

 say， he's 120 pounds，and then three months later，，he's 145 pounds。，How did you put on 25 pounds。

in a couple of months？，You're not natural。，Even though you're 6 foot and 145，and look skinny。

and everyone can achieve that，if you look natural，，it doesn't mean that he did。。

That is the hard part。，People have a hard time，seeing a physique that's average。

and saying they're natural。，Dr。 Justin Marchegiani: Interesting。，Dr。 Justin Marchegiani: Interesting。

，So what I would， um，，give us your top three fake natties。，Dr。 Justin Marchegiani: Uh-oh。，Dr。

 Justin Marchegiani: Of all time？，We got to go with the Rockies in there。。

You got to go with Michael Hearn，and you got to go with the liver cancer。

and you got to go with the liver king。，Dr。 Justin Marchegiani: Wait。 Sorry。，You said， okay。

 so Michael Hearn。，Dr。 Justin Marchegiani: Rock has to be in there，because of the sheer numbers。。

Like the sheer fame of it。，Not that he brags about it all the time，。

but like the fact that he's that famous，and has that much influence。。

Like I feel like if the Rock came out，and said， you know， you know，，Black Adam， you know，。

I was on 400 test， 400 trend。，Like if he just came out with that，，the world would change。。

Like he would be that influential。，So I think he would be，the biggest difference maker。。

I think Michael Hearn，，it's just a joke at this point。，Like does anyone think he's natural？。

Like he's sponsored by an HRT clinic。，He's in the shape of his life。，He's doing a movie role。。

He's guest posing the best he's ever。，Like I'm like， come on。，Like baby don't hurt me。。

Like the memes。，It's like Mike is a meme。，And the fact that he claims to be natural still。。

It's just shocking that people believe it。，And then the liver king，。

the sheer audacity to like in your face，repeatedly say， I'm not natural。，And that proved to me。

that he was lying。，Like that's like all time stuff right there。，Got you。。

And then any other honorable mentions，that you want to add in？。

I would say mostly it would be movie stars。，Like what's this guy？，The guy that plays Thor。。

I don't know the names。，Damn it。，Chris Hemsworth。，Chris Hemsworth。，That's a big like， I mean，。

this guy is not natural。，Like if you think Chris Hemsworth is natural，or like any of the superstars，。

like any of the guys with the best physique，that play all those Marvel characters，。

those are the ones that are really，making the biggest difference。。

Because imagine if he came out and said，，you know， I want 600 milligrams of Trent。。

Like what would that do？，Like so many， like I would，，my videos， my channel would be out for a month。。

Like it would be just like，，imagine this guy actually coming clean，，admitting it。。

Because they're so famous。，Like a guy like me，，I mean， some people hear about me，。

but not a lot compared to the Rock or these guys。，There's a hundred times more famous。。

And so one of those guys，could just shift the needle on people。

like just understanding what's going on。，What about Simeon Panda？，He's a huge fake daddy in the past。

，but I don't think he's as famous or as popular now。，He's kind of like old school。。

He would probably be on my list，if the list was made five years ago or more。，Okay。。

And then last mention，，Michael B。 Jordan。，This guy， like he's not natural。。

Like I'm saying he's not natural。，I've done two videos on this guy，，but it's not。，The problem is，。

a lot of people can look like that natural。，Like it's attainable natural。，And so people are like，。

yeah， but you can look like that natural。，I'm like， yeah， but he did。。

He said he put on 24 pounds of muscle，in whatever amount of time。

and he trained for three hours a day，and he was boxing for three hours，and training with weights。

and doing like 80 sets。，I'm like， no， you can't do all that。，Not sleep。

 overtrain and get that physique。，But it's like the amount of muscle。

he put on in such a short period of time，for the role that sells it，，that says this is not natural。。

And the fact that why the hell，would he be natural？，He's like， I want to look like a movie star。

and make millions of dollars。，And I have this avenue。，I'm not saying he's using a bunch of gear，。

but you have an HRT clinic，that can prescribe it to you，and do it in a healthy fashion。。

Why wouldn't you take advantage of that？，And so when there's $10 million on the line，。

you're going to take something。，Like， talk about it。，Yeah， no， that's absolutely true。。

So I hit these chats real quick，and then I got a few more questions，and we'll close this thing out。。

And guys， like the video， by the way。，There's almost 5，000 of y'all，watching right now live。。

And we only got 2。2K likes。，We need you guys to get us to 4，000 likes。，Almost got 5。

000 of y'all in here。，Okay， various layers。，So shout out to Fresh and Myron，，CEO Network。，Let's go。。

Also a question for Greg。，How many calories do you eat a day？，How do you balance cardio with lifting？

，I eat 3，500 a day on average，，but some days I'll eat more。，And cardio， I mean， I'm always sore，。

but I'm only training with weights，three days a week。，So what I did is I cut my training in half。。

I lift half as much as I used to。，And remember what I was saying。，We don't need as much lifting。

to keep your muscles， to build it。，So I'm like， well， I do half as much。。

Now I'm losing a little bit of muscle。，Like maybe I lost four pounds，the last like three， four years。

，But I'm 47 and I stopped using gear。，And so I'm doing a lot to keep what I have。。

But I just eat more food。，Like I eat more calories now，because I bike and burn a lot of calories。。

Like today's ride in an hour，，I burn 1，080 calories。，It's a lot。，Very hard race。。

And so I can eat like pretty much what I want。，Like very easy for me to maintain my body fat。

in single digits now。，Compared to， for example，，when I was blasting all the gear，，all of it。。

It was way harder for me to stay lean then than now，，even though I'm not on the gear now。。

And the difference，，the only difference is cardio。，Yeah。，Mike， Greg，。

if you could move your mic up just a little bit，，just so they can hear you a little bit better。，Cool。

 Awesome。，And then it says here，，6， 20 bucks goes。，Dieting is key。，However， to burn fat，。

would you recommend lifting more or cardio，more or equally the same？，Cardio by a landslide。。

The biggest underrated thing for fat burning，，cardio， way more than weights。。

Like you lift weights for an hour hard，，you're lucky to burn 300 calories。，Cardio， easy burn。

 double that。，You burn way more calories lifting weights。，And as you do it more，，you get better。

 you adapt to it，，you become a better butter burner，，you burn more calories in less length of time。。

It becomes even easier。，Like think of it，，I burn 1，000 calories an hour。，Most people burn 300， 400。。

So if you get good at it，，you can burn so many more calories，and eat so much more。。

And it lowers my appetite。，After I do a race，，I can't even eat for 2 hours。。

Like I'm almost sick to my stomach，from pushing so hard。，And so my appetite is blunted。

until later on。，And so it makes it easier to stay lean。，It's year-round cardio。，That is the secret。

to keeping yourself lean all the time。，Yes。，One of my buddies，，Brandon Carter， he does that。。

He basically like is on a bike，，cycling while he's doing work，and stuff like that。。

It actually helps him keep lean，or he walks a lot as well。，He recommended some crazy videos。。

He was saying you need to do，40，000 steps a day in one video。。

I made a video on him talking about that。，I'm like， dude， 40，000 steps。。

Do you know how long that takes？，2300 steps is a mile for me。，I'm like， you're gonna walk。

like for 4 to 6 hours a day，to get those steps in。，It works for sure，，but who got time to walk 40。

000 steps？，Oh， shit。，Yeah。 That's probably from the--，when he cycles，or when he walks on a treadmill。

，He wakes up early in the morning，to do the morning walk。，Yeah。，He's also keto，。

so he's not eating carbs。，So they probably benefits，from not having as much of an appetite。。

Like he's limiting certain food groups。，People who eat less food groups，like less carbs，。

they're often less hungry。，Problem is some people feel like，，shit， I can't follow that diet，。

like a keto diet。，I can't do it。，I get brain fog。，It's just not for me。，Yeah。，And also with keto。

 right，，you're eating meat。，Meat is way more satiating，than anything else， right？，Yeah。。

High protein meals，，much more satiating，，higher thermic effect of food，，bring up more calories，。

digesting it， absolutely。，Absolutely。，Coach Greg is a real one。，Also。

 thanks for your frickin' cookbook。，Okay。 They love it。，JB says， "Love Coach Greg。，Thanks， FNF。

 for the dialogue。，Only 2K likes on this vid。，Let's double it。"，Yeah， guys。，We got 5，000 plus y'all。

watching right now， timing。，Danny Brooke， W Collab， love you both。。

I give Greg 2 years before he has enough，with Castro Juniors Canada，and moves to the U。S。，Much love。

"，If I can get into the States，，I'll start with that。，Eat Clint Trenhard and never give up。。

And that's from Captain Ahab。，I knew that was coming。，Captain Ahab。，You gotta love the misc。。

And then Ever Blazer says，，"What up， FNF family？，Salute to the coach for a guy，that's 5'6"。

 about 145 pounds，，16% body fat。，Any tips on how to hit 160 pounds？"，A calorie surplus， of course。。

Yes。，Greg， what do you suggest people hit，as far as like so they don't get fat。

in their calorie surplus per day，if they're trying to build lean body mass？，No more than about 5%。

over what you're currently eating。，10% max， so the average person，，I would say eats 2。

700 calories a day。，Now， mind you， the average male is overweight。。

So most people should be eating less than that。，But all you need to do to gain weight，at a good rate。

 like a lean bulk，，5%， 10% tops。，So if you're eating 2，000，，it's only an extra 100 to 200 a day。。

Very small。，You only need 30 calories extra a day，to build 4 to 5 pounds of muscle in a year，。

which is the average person。，So I've often said，，"Hey， you only need 30 extra calories。"。

And I know you can't track this，，but I'm only just doing that，because I understand math。。

I taught math grade 7 to 12，，so I know math very well。，But if you're adding in。

100 extra calories a day，，I mean， that's a lot of muscle a day。。

You're talking about 15 pounds-ish muscle，in a year that can be built on that。。

Most people can't build that much。，So if you're even adding，100 calories a day，。

probably some of it's going to be body fat。，So very small surpluses。，-Yeah。，Charles。

 I got an offer to trade--，I got an offer to trade school for electrician。。

My current job is pretty easy and pays decent，，but I would only make up to 80K a year。，I'm only 22。

 live with my dad。，With a car payment， that's about it。，What's the right move？，Bro， 80K per year。

 make it happen，，and then you can always scale up， bro，，because you can become--。

you can become like a master electrician，，et cetera， so--。

Where are these people living that 80K isn't bad？，I was a school teacher making like 40。，Yeah， man。。

Not wrong with that， guys。，And you'll get a union。，You'll get a good retirement，。

a great skill to have，，and you can always--if you want，，you can start your own electrician business。。

But--so， Greg， real quick with that。，So it's Money Monday。，I got to ask you this。。

How does someone monetize in the fitness industry，，and how did you do it？，Well。

 I guess how I do it or anyone do it，is you have to find something。

that the people want and give it to them。，Like for me， it was like，，Coach Greg。

 can you make a cookbook？，Well， sure。，Like find something that you're good at。

and you're passionate about，and then promote it to your audience，and try to sell it。。

Like I'm not a guy that's gonna--，like a fan of bulking。，So if I came up with a book，and it said。

 you know，，all these recipes on how to gain weight，，well， why would I do that？，That's not about me。。

Like so you have to go along with your brand，and what you stand for。，Like I promote cardio fitness，。

and so I wrote a book。，Like， geez， the Circle Diet Book。，Like it's how to lose weight，。

keep it off for the rest of your life。，And you see my cookbooks，and training books， all this stuff。。

So I offer people what they want，based on my expertise。，So whatever that is，，whatever you're doing，。

sell people something that you're good at，，that you're an expert on，and that they want。。

The key is they have to want it。，Well said。，What are your biggest earners？。

The cookbook has made me the most money overall，，but now I make more on supplements，like a G。O。2 Max。

and all these supplements in the background，than the cookbook by a fair bit。。

How much does a cookbook made you？，If you don't mind disclosing。，I sold close to 100，000 copies。

and they're between like $100 and $150 each。，So 15 million， maybe 10， 15 million，。

something like that。，On a fucking cookbook。，Shout out to that。，That's what we're talking about， baby。

，Shout out to all the haters，that got mad at you for selling it for $100。，High ticket closer。。

No one's going to buy that。，You would sell。，You'd make so much more money，if you put the price down。。

I'm like， really？，Well， I'm not going to tell you，how many I sold。，I mean， I didn't want everyone。

to copy the book，because I was like， it's doing pretty good。，But like if I sold it for less，。

people almost buy less，because they're like，，oh， it can't be that good。。

There's a supply and demand curve，and it's like， you know，，there's a certain price point。

that's the right point。，I think I hit it。，Like， I mean， I did what I could do。，Yeah， Martha Stewart。

probably selling her books，for a similar price。，So why not？，And she's a felon。，Well， for lying。。

You for smuggling， right？，So， Greg， and then you said，the supplements。，Real quick， bro，。

because you succeeded，in the supplement industry。，I've seen so many people。

fail in the supplement industry。，It's very difficult。，You need a lot of money to get in。。

It's not expensive，to produce the supplements。，And then also like the margins。

aren't as much as people think。，Can you talk about，how you were able to build。

a successful supplement company？，Well， because I did so many videos，on like steroids and supplements。

and what I'm taking。，I have an IP pro card。，I've coached people，and people believe what I say。。

So I have a respected opinion。，And so it's not just how many followers。。

It's what kind of followers you have，and what you're famous for。，Like these TikTok girls and guys。

and whatever and dancing around。，Like I've tried to sponsor them。，They do nothing。，They do no sales。

because people aren't buying something。，If you have some pretty girl，and says， "It's bad。"，It's like。

 why？，You have to be able to explain things，so I can educate and teach people。。

So I've been able to sell so much more，than perhaps the average YouTuber。

that has like a million followers，as an example，because my channel is a go-to channel。

for fitness advice。，And so if I'm explaining a supplement，or a protein or whatever，and this is it。

and they take your word for it，then that's really important。，That's just how you do it。。

Like other people，，they're just not good at talking about stuff，or they don't know anything about it。

，Like how am I going to，how are you going to sell beta alanine，if you don't know why it works？。

If you don't know what it does，what's it like？，You just-- no one's buying it。。

So you have to be educated on it。，Yeah。，And I think also like the fact，that you're so honest，。

you're so transparent，，especially in the fitness industry。

where a lot of people are cappers and liars，and， "Oh， I'm Natty，"，and all this other stuff。。

You went against the grain。，You're like， "No， I'm going to，tell the truth on what I really do。。

I'm going to give you guys，my controversial takes，on certain social situations。"，And you know。

 when it comes to sales，，people like have to like， know， and trust you。。

And I think that's another big thing as well。，You have a good amount of--，Yeah。，Like。

 think of what I'm talking about。，Like， my past， like selling--，like。

 all the shit I've done in the past，and I've been open book。，I'm like， "Yeah， that's true。。

This is true。"，And so， like， why would I start，lying about something。

when I've always just told the truth？，Like， when I say I'm on，140 milligrams of test，。

that's what I'm on。，It's like， these are the supplements，that I'm taking， this is what I'm taking。。

If I took GH， I'd say， "Hey， I took GH。，This is what it's doing。"，Like， there's no reason to lie。。

It's like， it's so easy to not lie。，You just tell the truth all the time。。

You just don't have to pretend。，So I think people believe that。，It makes it a lot more trustworthy。

source of information。，So that's why they're going to，buy supplements from me。，Right。，Hey， man。，Greg。

 I really enjoyed this interview， man。，I know you got probably some more。

bike riding to do or some food to eat。，I raced for an hour earlier。，I'm done。。

Where can the people find you， man？，On my Instagram。，Greg， you said IBPRO。，Also， obviously。

 on YouTube。，That's where people got me。，I can't do it on TikTok。。

I've been canceled too many times there。，Although there's an impersonator。，I think he has like 160。

000 followers。，He just reposts all my videos。，Free advertising。，Sell some kind of groceries，。

chart or something。，But not making money。，But at least， like， I walk around。，I say。

 "One in four people，that walk up to me now are like，，'Oh， I've seen you on TikTok。'，I'm like。

 'I don't even have a TikTok account。'"，Same。 Same， dude。 Same。，It's free advertising。，It's crazy。。

But it's free advertising，，so it is what it is。，Yeah， man。，Hey， man。，It was great having you on。

 Greg。，I hope that you get this thing sorted out，with Customs so that you can，come over to Stateside。

and we can do a show，instead of an interview with some girls。，That'd be dope。，That'd be great。，So。
