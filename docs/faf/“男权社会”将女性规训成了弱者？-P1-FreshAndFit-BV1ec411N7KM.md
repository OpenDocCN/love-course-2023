# “男权社会”将女性规训成了弱者？ - P1 - FreshAndFit - BV1ec411N7KM

Women are very good in high school， then they go to college， they are very good in college。

 they nail their damn grades， they do their studying。

 they get their A's and they ace their LSAT so they are smart too。。

Then they go off to do their articling and they are really really good at it。。

And then they get offered an associate position and they are really really good at it。。

And then by the time they are 30 they make partner and let's say they are in high pressure。

 high paying jobs。，$250，000 a year， $300，000 a year， $500 an hour。，Okay， what's your life like？。

You work all the time， period。，70 hours a week， 75 hours a week， flat out。。

And you can say all you want about the fact that women have a difficult time with that because it's a male dominated patriarchy。

，Any female lawyer who's hit 30 and has a partner that has any sense at all knows that's complete bloody rubbish。

，It's market determined right to the core。，What happens to the women when they are in their 30s？。

They all leave the high end law firms。，Why？，Why？，Cause who in their right mind would wanna live like that？
