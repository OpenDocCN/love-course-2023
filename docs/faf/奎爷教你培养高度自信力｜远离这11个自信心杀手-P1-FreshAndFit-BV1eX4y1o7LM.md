# 奎爷教你培养高度自信力 ｜ 远离这11个自信心杀手 - P1 - FreshAndFit - BV1eX4y1o7LM

Boy， wake up to reality。 The world is changing before your eyes。

 and men are getting weaker by the day。 Why？，The modern world is full of traps to break men down and keep them far away from their potential。

 As a result， most guys have low confidence and low testosterone。，However。

 there are some men that have unbreakable confidence。

 They enjoy crushing obstacles and handle any problem。 And I will help you become one of those men。。

In this video， we will go over 11 things that destroy your confidence。，1。 Mental conditioning。

Most guys are conditioned for failure ever since childhood。

 programmed to lose without even knowing it。 It is the sad reality。

 I will tell you a shocking story about how it works。，Listen。 In many countries。

 baby elephants get a small rope tied around their leg。

 This rope prevents them from escaping and running away。，As the elephant grows older。

 he becomes one of the most powerful creatures on the planet。

 and he could easily break free from that little rope。，However。

 the adult has already been conditioned to believe it's impossible to break free。

 so he doesn't even try to fight it。 No matter how powerful the elephants become， they never escape。。

You see， even the strongest beast can be broken by mental conditioning。 That's how effective it is。

 Humans are no different。，Like the elephant， you've been conditioned for failure by teachers。

 society， the news， maybe even by your own parents。，People get conditioned into limiting beliefs。

 and that leads to low confidence。，To break free， you must analyze yourself。

 What are limiting beliefs you have？ Who made you believe them？，Once you figure that out。

 you can break the chains of conditioning and reprogram your mind for success。。

 Make sure you subscribe so you don't miss them。，2。 Social media，After mental conditioning。

 social media might be the biggest confidence killers in the modern world。 Think about it。。

You only see people living their best life online， making more money and getting girls。。

Everyone always seems to be doing better than you。 It makes you feel like trash。，Here is the reality。

 No one shares their bad side on social media。，They only show highlights or even use fakery to flex。

 It is a fake reality。，You can draw inspiration from it， but never let it impact your confidence。，3。

 Adult content，When you're fapping and watching adult content。

 you are watching another guy having sex with a woman。。

You would be embarrassed if a cat walked into your room while you're watching it。

 That's how embarrassing it is。，4。 Cancel culture，In the modern and feminized world。

 it's hard for a man to unapologetically be a man。。

Most guys get shamed over and over again until they change their minds or become afraid to speak their mind。

，Their confidence gets broken。 Pathetic！，A man should never apologize for being a man。。

If you have your own ambition， goals and desires， there is no reason to feel bad about it。。

Remember that the world around you is trying to feminize you and break your masculinity。。

Do not allow them to have their way。，5。 Neglecting your appearance。

Many guys don't care about how they look。 They skip the barber often and dress poorly。。

It's crucial to understand that when you neglect your appearance。

 you're effectively disrespecting yourself。，Although it might seem like a superficial aspect。

 taking good care of your looks can actually do a lot to boost your self-confidence。，6。

 Terrible body posture，Since ancient times， it's been ingrained in humans to scan their surroundings for danger constantly。

，Body language was a crucial indicator of whether a man was difficult to read。。

It drew women to you and earned the respect of men。，Nothing has changed。。

We still judge others by body language even though most people don't even realize it。。

When you have weak and slumping body language， others will see you as a weaker man。。

But more importantly， you will subconsciously see yourself as a weaker man instead of a warrior。，7。

 Win，It's impossible to have any confidence if you only lose。，You must win more than you lose。。

Losses are inevitable。 They will come your way。，But you must do everything in your power to rack up wins。

，When you accomplish things， you will earn your own respect。。

And this results in an increase of confidence。，8。 Making excuses。

I have observed a lot of weak men whining about their life these days。

 expecting attention and sympathy to be given to them。，Pathetic！。

No man will ever be confident if he relies on other people to make him happy or content。。

As I said before， losses will come your way。，But you must accept responsibility instead of making excuses。

，9。 Instant gratification，What comes up must come down。，If you seek short-term pleasure。

 it comes with a price。，That is why you will feel like garbage after binge-watching Netflix shows without earning it。

，Chasing cheap and easy dopamine always comes with a price。，And the price will be paid in full。。

While delayed gratification has the opposite effect。。

If you go out for a run in the cold or do a brutal leg day。

 it won't feel comfortable or sweet in the moment。，But you feel amazing after you finish。。

Confidence will rise when you follow the path of delayed gratification。，10。

 Breaking promises you made with yourself，Every time you don't do something you planned to do is the moment you lose belief in yourself。

，And if you don't even believe in yourself， it is impossible to be confident。。

Make your goal smaller if you have to， but stick to your own promises。，11。

 Taking everything personally，When you find yourself in a situation where someone says or does something that offends you。

，it's easy to take it personally and let it destroy your confidence。，If you want high confidence。

 it's important to know how to not take things personally。。

Some people are miserable themselves and they will project it onto you。。

It makes them feel better about their own situation if they can drag someone else down with them。。

This will happen more and more often if you are doing good。。

Don't let it bother you and don't take it personally。，By the way， if you want to level up in life。
