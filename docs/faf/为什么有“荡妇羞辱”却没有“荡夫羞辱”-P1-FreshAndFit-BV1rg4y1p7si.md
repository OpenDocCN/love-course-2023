Wireman，Taken down，Women is easy people are not praise for doing what easy it is。

Hard for men to get late，It is not a double standard it is a different standard air go man are studs women are slots。

People are rewarded and revered for doing what's hard。

It's not easy for men to get late but any average looking woman could walk into a bar and。

She can get laid just like that，People are not going to revere you for doing what's easy that's what this is why studs are praised。

And slots are admonished，This is nothing to do with the patriarchy what's the first thing you call what's the first thing to call a woman we don't like her。

Exactly when I call each other who's all the time but when men but when men call each other。

we call losers all your men so you can get laid，it's it's literally the same thing。
