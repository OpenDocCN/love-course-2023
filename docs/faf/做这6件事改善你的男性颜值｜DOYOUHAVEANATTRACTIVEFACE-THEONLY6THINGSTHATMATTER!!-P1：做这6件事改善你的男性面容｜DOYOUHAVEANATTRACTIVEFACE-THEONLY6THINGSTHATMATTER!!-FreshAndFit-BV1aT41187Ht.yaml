    THAT MATTER!! - FreshAndFit - BV1aT41187HtJeffrey is a blackpillar，There''s nothing
    you can do to improve your looks， it''s all over。You''re coping， it''s over for
    you curry cells，You should just kill yourself。That''s how blackpillars actually
    talk，They tell young men who are feeling insecure to kill themselves。if they don''t
    have a certain height or characteristics of their face。Blackpillars like Jeffrey
    hate to see you on self-improvement，They don''t want to be proved wrong。Jeffrey
    will try to pull you back down into the bucket of the crabs。He doesn''t want you
    to invalidate his excuses，For a long time I thought I was ugly。and I genuinely
    thought that there was nothing I could do about it。I thought I was ugly simply
    because I was brown-skinned。and I had this belief that brown people were just
    unattractive。especially to the white women that I wanted，It was only until I adopted
    a positive thinking mindset。when I started going to the gym，and I realized that
    progress was possible。I started to convince myself that I could also progress
    my face。I did research and I found a bunch of things，and I found that there''s
    only around five things。that truly can change how attractive your face is，and
    it''s worth implementing all of these。Here is a picture of what I used to look
    like when I was 18，and here is the pictures that I take now。Adonis，'
- summary: '-   Adonis的颅骨是一个战士，看起来非常出色，他看起来很惊人，下巴线条如同宙斯的长矛一样锋利，猎人般的眼睛让黑柱们自豪。面部吸引力只有六个重要因素：低体脂、舌头姿势、头部姿势、颈部大小、面部锻炼和胡须。首先是低体脂，这是显而易见的常识，但有些人仍然体脂过高。理想的体脂率目标应该在10%到12%左右，这时你的腹肌完全可见，甚至可能在腹部和V线周围有一些静脉，下巴线条明显，没有下垂的皮肤。要想看起来更好，体脂率要低，你希望体重尽可能高，同时保持苗条，方法是先增肌，然后再减脂。'
  text: Adonis has a warrior skull，What a fine specimen indeed，He looks phenomenal。with
    a jawline as sharp as the spear of Zeus，and the hunter eyes that would make blackpillars
    proud。There's only six things that matter，in terms of your facial attractiveness，Low
    body fat。Tongue posture，Head posture，Neck size，Face exercises，and beard。and we're
    gonna discuss exactly how to improve these，But Hamza，Hamza， what about navel，
    canvil。tint and hunter，Oh， shut up， bro，F**k blackpillars， man。We're not gonna
    discuss things that you can't change，because at least to me。that's a complete
    waste of time，There's of course a hundred different tiny bits of your face。that
    make up the attractiveness，but thinking about something that you can't change，is
    for losers。So let's go through in order of importance，Firstly， low body fat，This
    is obvious and common sense。but some guys still have too high of a body fat percentage。The
    ideal body fat that you should set the goal off，is around 10 to 12%。This is when
    your abs are completely visible，You may even have some veins around your abs and
    your V-line。and you'll have a sharp jawline，with no baggy skin underneath，One
    huge point that no one mentions。in terms of low body fat，is that to look even
    better，at a low body fat percentage。you want to weigh more，You simply want your
    body weight，to be as high as possible。whilst also remaining lean，and the way to
    do that is to bulk up first，and then cut to get leaner。This is what I looked like
    at 120 pounds，and I was fairly lean，

    \    3.  通过鼻子呼吸可以改善外貌，避免口呼吸导致的问题。"
  text: but you can see that my face。didn't exactly look chiseled，Whereas when I put
    on a fair amount of muscle，two to three years later。this is what I looked like
    at 150 pounds，You can see a big difference in my jawline。The more that you weigh
    whilst being lean，the better that you'll look。Focus on increasing your body weight，and
    then cutting，Tongue posture is very very important。and it's something to be mindful
    of 24/7，Here is what people look like，when they are mouth breathers。and here's
    what people look like，when they breathe from their nose。I was a mouth breather
    for most of my adult life，My nose would always be stuffy。and I realized how to
    fix this，You simply need to breathe from your nose more。And you're probably thinking，Wait，
    Hamza， f**k you，You literally just said your nose is stuffy。like I can't breathe
    from my nose，so how do I breathe，However much you can breathe from your nose。is
    generally how much you need to，So let's say if your nose is literally 85% blocked。and
    you can just about barely breathe，It's almost like a meditation practice。to breathe
    as much as you can，without doing that bulls**t that most people do，which is to
    like force。Don't do that stupid bulls**t，Just calmly breathe silently through
    your nose。and that's how much air you should be taking in，The reason why your
    nose is generally blocked。even though you'll believe that you've got allergies。or
    any bulls**t that you've been convinced by doctors。Generally the reason why so
    many people's noses block。
- summary: "-   Proper breathing through the nose can lead to improved tongue posture\
    \ and overall facial structure.\n    1.  Breathing through the nose helps open\
    \ up the airways and promotes correct tongue posture.\n    2.  Focus on breathing\

  text: is because they simply don't breathe from their nose，because they breathe
    from their mouth。The more that you breathe from your nose，the more it'll open
    up。But you need to go through the trials and tribulations，of breathing through
    your nose。when you can hardly do so，And it's completely safe，And it's even healthier
    to do this。Simply breathe through your nose，in a very silent， calm way，and do
    a full exhale。Breathing from your nose，will allow you to assume the correct tongue
    posture。which is when your mouth is closed，Your tongue presses up against the
    top of your mouth。And you wanna really focus on getting most of your tongue，against
    the top of your mouth。Not just the tip， but most of it，It takes some practice，I
    don't care what anyone says。This literally changes the shape of your skull，Once
    again， these are pictures of me。when I ended puberty at around age 18，And two
    years later。I still remember this blue picture in the gym，When you can literally
    see that my face。started to grow outwards，in more of like a warrior skull shape，Head
    posture is very， very important。And it's so overlooked，in terms of facial attractiveness，Everyone，
    especially you。has some terrible head posture，because of all the technology，Everyone's
    got， like， their neck up。because we're always doing this s**t，Do you notice your
    phone？，Sometimes I'm in the gym。And I literally see someone using their phone
    like this，Like a f**king freak， bro。And you just see everyone like this，

  text: The simple way to improve your head posture。which improves your attractiveness，is
    simply just give yourself a double chin，as a stretch。Hold it for two seconds，The
    more you do this，the more your neck will start going back。And you'll assume that
    good， confident， strong posture。where your shoulders are back and neck is back，that
    Jordan Peterson promotes，The size of your neck。actually makes a big difference
    in your face，And you're probably thinking， okay。we wanted to talk about face，why
    are you talking about neck？，Your neck is always visible。And in terms of muscle
    and size，and testosterone and masculinity，Oftentimes people subconsciously。will
    see your neck size，as the size of the man that you are，When you see someone with
    a thick neck。even if the rest of their body is cropped out，you automatically have
    some kind of respect for this guy。and you wouldn't want to mess with him，But when
    you see a guy with a skinny neck。and his body's cropped out，you think， yeah， I
    could， you know，this is a skinny guy， it's no problem。We could show you the rest
    of his body，and he could be massive，But you wouldn't have thought that。if you
    only saw his neck，It's very important to train your neck。with the rest of your
    body in the gym，as we've been doing。And the simplest way to increase your neck
    size，is simply to do neck curls。where you just place a small weight on your forehead，and
    just curl your neck like this。when you're laying off a bench，The fifth thing you
    can do，

  text: to improve your facial attractiveness。is the face exercises，And these are
    generally kind of weird，And I'll be completely honest。I don't really do these
    that much，But there is one thing that I do heavily recommend。which is to chew
    harder foods，The shape of our skull and jaws are getting smaller。because we're
    chewing very soft， processed foods，Any food that's rough and hard like nuts。is
    very helpful for training the muscles，around the jawline。And you can also do a
    bunch of different facial exercises，which look kind of weird。My friend Chris at
    First Man，made a full video on the facial exercises，which I'll link below。And
    finally the last thing that you can do，is grow and also shape your beard。to improve
    your facial attractiveness，If you can't grow a beard just yet。and you feel like
    you should have the genetics to do so，so everyone in your family can grow a beard。even
    your mother，Then it's just because you haven't actualised，your masculinity yet。This
    is like bro science，and everyone disagrees with me，But I'm 100% sure of this。If
    you are genetically capable of getting a beard，you will get it when you become
    more masculine。when you become more of a man，and you take responsibility，Take
    more responsibility。Look after more people，Become a leader，And you'll see that
    your beard will grow faster than ever。If you've already got a beard，It's very
    important that you shape it in a certain way。Which is to have the moustache and
    the chin，Longer than the cheek and the side lines。
- summary: "-   Shaping the underside of the beard is crucial for a good look.\n \
    \   1.  Trim the beard to the jawline and have it come down.\n    2.  Leave about\
    \ an inch near the chin.\n    3.  It's important to put in the effort, even when\
    \ you don't feel like it."
  text: A very important part of making your beard look good，Is shaping the underside
    of it。You want to trim up the beard，To your jawline around the cheek here，And
    have the beard come down。About an inch near the chin like this，Do the hard work。Especially
    when you don't feel like it。
