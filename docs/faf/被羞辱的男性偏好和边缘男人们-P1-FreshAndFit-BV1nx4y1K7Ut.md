# 被羞辱的男性偏好和边缘男人们 - P1 - FreshAndFit - BV1nx4y1K7Ut

Yeah， women have their preferences and it's the same thing with men。，Well， it's not the same thing。

 let me explain。，When a man says he has a preference， he's shamed for having a preference。。

A woman is literally allowed to say， "I won't date a man with less than 10 inches of dick。"。

And nobody ever says that that's a problem that she said that。，Men's decisions are questioned。。

If I won't date a fat woman， they'll say， "Why not？ Your body's shamed。 Your momma's faked。"，Yeah。

 there's all these words that never apply to men。，A fat woman can only be fat-shamed。

 A fat man is just fat。，There's a girl out there right now by the name of Lizzo。。

And people are encouraging her to do everything except what would save her life。

 which is lose weight。，No， but she is like。。。，And there's no man that they're doing that to。。

There's no man that they're out there saying， "Make sure when he take his shirt off。

 we let him feel good about his body。"，(字幕製作/時間軸:秋月AutumnMoon)。
