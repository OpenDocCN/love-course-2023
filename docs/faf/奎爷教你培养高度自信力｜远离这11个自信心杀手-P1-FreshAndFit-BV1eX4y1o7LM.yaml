    to reality。 The world is changing before your eyes。and men are getting weaker
    by the day。 Why？，The modern world is full of traps to break men down and keep
    them far away from their potential。As a result， most guys have low confidence
    and low testosterone。，However。there are some men that have unbreakable confidence。They
    enjoy crushing obstacles and handle any problem。 And I will help you become one
    of those men。。In this video， we will go over 11 things that destroy your confidence。，1。
    Mental conditioning。Most guys are conditioned for failure ever since childhood。programmed
    to lose without even knowing it。 It is the sad reality。I will tell you a shocking
    story about how it works。，Listen。 In many countries。baby elephants get a small
    rope tied around their leg。This rope prevents them from escaping and running away。，As
    the elephant grows older。he becomes one of the most powerful creatures on the
    planet。and he could easily break free from that little rope。，However。the adult
    has already been conditioned to believe it''s impossible to break free。so he doesn''t
    even try to fight it。 No matter how powerful the elephants become， they never
    escape。。You see， even the strongest beast can be broken by mental conditioning。
    That''s how effective it is。Humans are no different。，Like the elephant， you''ve
    been conditioned for failure by teachers。society， the news， maybe even by your
    own parents。，'
- summary: '-   People get conditioned into limiting beliefs, leading to low confidence.
    To break free, analyze and identify these beliefs and their origins. Reprogram
    your mind for success by breaking the chains of conditioning.

    -   Social media can be a major confidence killer post-mental conditioning. Comparing
    yourself to others online can lead to feelings of inadequacy.

    -   Watching adult content can be embarrassing and impact confidence negatively.
    It''s important to be mindful of the content you consume.

    -   Cancel culture can lead to men feeling ashamed and losing confidence. It''s
    important to stand by your beliefs and not apologize for being yourself.'
  text: People get conditioned into limiting beliefs。and that leads to low confidence。，To
    break free， you must analyze yourself。What are limiting beliefs you have？ Who
    made you believe them？，Once you figure that out。you can break the chains of conditioning
    and reprogram your mind for success。。More videos about how to control your own
    mind will be made in the future。Make sure you subscribe so you don't miss them。，2。
    Social media，After mental conditioning。social media might be the biggest confidence
    killers in the modern world。 Think about it。。You only see people living their
    best life online， making more money and getting girls。。Everyone always seems to
    be doing better than you。 It makes you feel like trash。，Here is the reality。No
    one shares their bad side on social media。，They only show highlights or even use
    fakery to flex。It is a fake reality。，You can draw inspiration from it， but never
    let it impact your confidence。，3。Adult content，When you're fapping and watching
    adult content。you are watching another guy having sex with a woman。。You would
    be embarrassed if a cat walked into your room while you're watching it。That's
    how embarrassing it is。，4。 Cancel culture，In the modern and feminized world。it's
    hard for a man to unapologetically be a man。。Most guys get shamed over and over
    again until they change their minds or become afraid to speak their mind。，Their
    confidence gets broken。 Pathetic！，A man should never apologize for being a man。。If
    you have your own ambition， goals and desires，
- summary: "-   Feeling bad about yourself is unnecessary as the world tries to feminize\
    \ and weaken masculinity. Neglecting appearance shows self-disrespect and affects\
    \ self-confidence. Body posture is crucial for projecting strength and confidence.\
    \ Winning and avoiding excuses are key to building confidence and self-respect.\n\

    \ appearance affects self-confidence.\n    3.  Body posture is crucial for projecting\

    \ confidence and self-respect."
  text: ' there is no reason to feel bad about it。。Remember that the world around
    you is trying to feminize you and break your masculinity。。Do not allow them to
    have their way。，5。 Neglecting your appearance。Many guys don''t care about how
    they look。 They skip the barber often and dress poorly。。It''s crucial to understand
    that when you neglect your appearance。you''re effectively disrespecting yourself。，Although
    it might seem like a superficial aspect。taking good care of your looks can actually
    do a lot to boost your self-confidence。，6。Terrible body posture，Since ancient
    times， it''s been ingrained in humans to scan their surroundings for danger constantly。，Body
    language was a crucial indicator of whether a man was difficult to read。。It drew
    women to you and earned the respect of men。，Nothing has changed。。We still judge
    others by body language even though most people don''t even realize it。。When you
    have weak and slumping body language， others will see you as a weaker man。。But
    more importantly， you will subconsciously see yourself as a weaker man instead
    of a warrior。，7。Win，It''s impossible to have any confidence if you only lose。，You
    must win more than you lose。。Losses are inevitable。 They will come your way。，But
    you must do everything in your power to rack up wins。，When you accomplish things，
    you will earn your own respect。。And this results in an increase of confidence。，8。
    Making excuses。I have observed a lot of weak men whining about their life these
    days。'
- summary: "-   信赖他人使自己快乐或满足是不可能的，损失会发生，但必须承担责任而非找借口。\n    1.  寻求即时满足会带来代价，延迟满足则有相反效果。\n\
    \    2.  不遵守自己的承诺会削弱自信。\n    3.  不要将他人的行为个人化，了解如何不把事情放在心上是重要的。"
  text: expecting attention and sympathy to be given to them。，Pathetic！。No man will
    ever be confident if he relies on other people to make him happy or content。。As
    I said before， losses will come your way。，But you must accept responsibility instead
    of making excuses。，9。 Instant gratification，What comes up must come down。，If you
    seek short-term pleasure。it comes with a price。，That is why you will feel like
    garbage after binge-watching Netflix shows without earning it。，Chasing cheap and
    easy dopamine always comes with a price。，And the price will be paid in full。。While
    delayed gratification has the opposite effect。。If you go out for a run in the
    cold or do a brutal leg day。it won't feel comfortable or sweet in the moment。，But
    you feel amazing after you finish。。Confidence will rise when you follow the path
    of delayed gratification。，10。Breaking promises you made with yourself，Every time
    you don't do something you planned to do is the moment you lose belief in yourself。，And
    if you don't even believe in yourself， it is impossible to be confident。。Make
    your goal smaller if you have to， but stick to your own promises。，11。Taking everything
    personally，When you find yourself in a situation where someone says or does something
    that offends you。，it's easy to take it personally and let it destroy your confidence。，If
    you want high confidence。it's important to know how to not take things personally。。Some
    people are miserable themselves and they will project it onto you。。
