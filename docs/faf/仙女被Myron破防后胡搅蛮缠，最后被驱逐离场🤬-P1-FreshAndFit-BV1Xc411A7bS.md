confidence ambition income etc experience that takes time。

man is 35 is not the same as a woman is 35 at all，so many sugar daddies man。

as a men age like wine women typically age like milk。

now can you push the clock back a little bit as a woman you go to the gym you take care of yourself do some kegels whatever yeah for sure。

but you never gonna be able to compete with your 21 year old self when you are 31 bro，period。

the other things too from a biological perspective most of your eggs are gone by the time you are 35。

consider a high risk pregnancy，and by the time you are 30 like 80% of your eggs plus are gone。

so if a man wants to have a family you can't even give him children。

you are virtually useless from a biological standpoint，that's the truth，that is the truth。

that's facts from a biological standpoint，if I wanna have a family and I am marrying a chick that is 35 years old。

there is a higher than 90% chance that I will not be able to have children with her。

I know a couple right，I know a couple that are deeply in love，he loved her she loved him。

she was 35 and he was like 42，and what happened was he was trying to have kids for like years。

and he just said to her one day he was like yo you know what I love you but I want kids and you can't give that to me。

and he left and I was sad because like they really loved each other。

and that's the biggest honor that you can bestow upon a man is children and a family。

and if you are in your 30s you can't do that，a lot of the time。

now are there women capable for sure don't get me twisted，but the chances go down。

do you have anything to say to that you seem really mad。

I'm not mad I just don't understand why you think men are better than women。

to me that's what it sounds like，no to me that's what it sounds like you think that men are better than women。

I didn't hear that one time though，not me either，at what point did I ever say men are better than women。

I mean just the way you are speaking you do think that men are better than women，how did I say that。

I don't have anything to say，the problem is that you are interpreting what I'm saying through your feelings versus logic。

I simply said that women don't have the same biological time clock that men do。

that does not mean that one gender is better than the other，you are in your feelings right now。

yeah she is，yeah she is super in her feelings，I'm in my feelings，you are bro，shout out to T Grizzly。

we got some more chats here，how do you extrapolate you think men are better than women off of me stating biological facts。

next topic，but I feel like，no no we don't need to move the topic。

how can you extrapolate that from what I just said，next topic。

no no no no we are not going to know next topic，how did you come to that conclusion，next topic。

how did you come to that conclusion，next topic，who's show do you think you are in，my show。

get the fuck off the show bro，get the fuck out of here。

you are not going to disrespect the platform like that，I will go，it's ridiculous。

there you go Frank Castle，oh my god，alright，and you knocked the mic over she is fucking tight。

yep she is like um，triggered，yeah she is triggered as fuck，I would be too。

I'm going to make sure she don't fuck up my shit，alright，hey chill，call us fuck，I'll petty he is not。

I was sick watching my live broadcast，this shit is going on way too long though。

like y'all got me tired，what time is it，I'm hungry I'm thirsty I'm tired，like，I need a drink，that's。

I'm like I can't even think anymore，yo Tyler。
