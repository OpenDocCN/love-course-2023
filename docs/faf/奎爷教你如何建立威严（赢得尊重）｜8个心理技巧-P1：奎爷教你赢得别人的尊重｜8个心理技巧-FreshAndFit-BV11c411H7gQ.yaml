    every man wants it， but few will ever get it。Most will die without ever knowing
    what respect tastes like。，Listen。there is a psychology behind getting respect，
    and when you understand it。you will be shocked at how good it works。 Let us discuss
    8 psychological ways to make people respect you。，1。 Force Respect Wake up to reality。
    Respect is forced。We live in a civilized world where people will pretend it isn''t
    true。They lose their minds when you say respect is forced。It triggers them simply
    because they don''t understand it。，Here is the truth。Respect is directly linked
    to fear。 That is why you respect a lion over a mosquito。One look in the lion''s
    eyes will force respect down your spine。while you wouldn''t hesitate to slap a
    mosquito to death。，Both are living creatures， and yet。you only respect the one
    that could kill you in a single strike。 It is no coincidence。 In fact。it is the
    same reason why all believers proudly admit to fear God。He is the most merciful
    and loving， but he is also the most powerful， and that forces respect。。I will
    give you one last example。 If you were to get into a fight with an MMA fighter
    with insane knockout power。you would respect him for it， even if that opponent
    has insulted you in the worst ways possible。You would still respect his knockout
    abilities， even if that''s the only thing you respect about him。You are forced
    to do so。，'
- summary: "-   Forcing respect is about possessing undeniable power or capabilities\
    \ that command respect, without needing to abuse it. It is better to be truly\
    \ capable than to ask for respect, and delaying responses can enhance authority\
    \ and mystery.\n    1.  True respect comes from being undeniably capable, not\
    \ from asking for it or pretending to be powerful.\n    2.  Delaying responses\
    \ can imply authority and control, creating a sense of mystery and intrigue.\n\
    \    3.  Calling out bad behavior, especially from those you care about, is important\
    \ to maintain respect and boundaries."
  text: Forcing respect does not make you a bad person or a tyrant。It doesn't mean
    you abuse people。 All it means is that you possess a form of power or capabilities
    that cannot be denied。whether people like it or not。 Even if you are a peaceful
    man and you decide not to use it。people are still forced to respect it。，Listen，
    if you truly want to be respected。you should never ask for it。 Instead， you must
    become so undeniably capable that people are simply forced to respect you。You
    could also trick people into believing you are more capable than you actually
    are。and psychologically it works very well。 But I recommend you become a powerful
    man instead of pretending to be one。，2。 Delay your response，If you want to make
    an impression， simply make people wait for your response。It may seem counterintuitive，
    but it works like a charm。 Why？A delayed response directly implies authority。
    It shows you are in control and answer at your own pace。It also promotes an aura
    of mystery around you， leaving people wondering what is going on in your mind。，You
    can boost the mystery further by using the art of subtlety。 For example。you could
    show a hint of a smile as you take your time to respond。What may appear to be
    nothing more than a simple gesture of friendliness to some can be interpreted
    as power and control。，3。 Call people out on bad behavior，If people display poor
    behavior around you。especially if it's people you care about， you should call
    them out on it。 They might not like it。
- summary: "-   人们会尊重你的性格。赢得尊重的不总是人们当下喜欢的东西。\n    1.  尊重时间。时间是我们最宝贵的资产，如果别人不尊重你的时间，意味着他们不太看重你。\n\
    \    2.  尊重彼此的时间。赞美对手，贬低别人的成功和才华是失去尊重的简单方法。\n    3.  表达思想清晰。坚定地表达自己的想法是重要的，不确定的表达会立即破坏尊重。"

    always what people like in the moment。，4。 Defend your time。Time is the most valuable
    asset we have， and when people don't respect your time。it means they don't think
    very much of you。 If you have an appointment with someone and the person is going
    to be late。the very least they can do is let you know in advance if they're running
    late。That way you can still postpone or cancel the meeting。，5。 Respect each other's
    time。Compliment the opponent，Tearing down a person's success and talents is an
    easy way to instantly lose respect。no matter how justified you are in sharing
    your opinion。That is why it's important to praise people genuinely and show the
    level of your confidence。even if they are your competition。，6。 Articulate your
    thoughts well，Hold your sentences strongly。Most people aren't deliberate enough
    about the kind of impression they want to leave on people when they are in social
    interactions。This is why they'll stutter and blur out their words when they talk。Not
    holding your sentences strong when you're talking immediately sends a signal that
    you're not sure of yourself。and this is an instant respect killer。，We believe
    people who appear sure of what they are saying。Even if you're not talkative or
    loud， you can learn to hold your words like you mean them when you're talking。，7。
    Ask persuasive and in-depth questions，Most people think that in order to be influential
    and intelligent。
- summary: "-   人们知道自己最适合什么，因此你的影响力在于引导问题，而不是直接说出答案。通过提问，你会留下聪明的印象。\n    1.  引导问题比直接表达知识更有影响力。\n\
    \    2.  许多治疗师通过提问展现智慧。\n    3.  保持价值观，赢得他人尊重，也赢得自己的尊重。\n-   一些人的价值观会随环境变化，这种缺乏一致性被称为缺乏诚信。坚守自己的价值观，赢得他人和自己的尊重。\n\
    \    1.  价值观的一致性是诚信的体现。\n    2.  坚守价值观赢得他人尊重。\n    3.  先赢得自己的尊重，才能赢得他人的尊重。"
  text: they must constantly talk to people and react to whatever arises。 However。people
    already know what is best for them。 Therefore。your influence will be found in
    guiding questions that help people explore themselves and the environment rather
    than what you say。，You see， the impact is found in the questions you ask rather
    than the knowledge you speak。When you do this， you will leave the impression of
    being very intelligent even though you only asked a few questions。Think about
    it。 Many therapists are well-respected and seen as highly intelligent in what
    is it they really do。They ask questions and let the other person do most of the
    talking。，8。 Uphold your values。Some people have values that change depending on
    who they are with。 For instance。they may say they don't drink， but once they are
    with friends who drink。they compromise so that they don't become the weird one
    in the group。Some don't even need a group to compromise their values。 Once they
    are alone。they find themselves doing things that they wouldn't do when they are
    in public。This conflict of values is what's otherwise called a lack of integrity。。When
    you hold your values to others， you earn their respect。And when you uphold your
    values to yourself， you earn your own respect。And you need your own respect first
    before others can respect you。，By the way。if you want to level up in life， don't
