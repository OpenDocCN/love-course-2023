    a high-value woman？，A woman who knows her worth and knows she can do better than
    that。Because there are men out there that aren''t gonna wanna see a whole bunch
    of women at one time。But what determines a woman''s worth？，I think a woman determines
    her own value，See。that''s the difference between men and women，Like a man can''t
    just determine their value。The world dictates how valuable you are，The marketplace
    you''re saying，Right， like how it works。Women can just make up how valuable she
    is in her head。And then just assume that the world should follow that，But we can''t
    operate like that。Imagine if I said like that，I''m just worth that，Like why？，Cause
    I believe it。Everybody would think that I''m delusional，But women can believe
    that。MING PAO CANADA | MING PAO TORONTO。'
