# 女权主义者女扮男装两年后抑郁最终自尽 - P1：女权主义者女扮男装两年后选择了自尽 - FreshAndFit - BV1Zo4y1z7Jp

Nora Vincent has died by assisted suicide，She was a radical feminist who believed men lived on easy mode。

and tried to prove it by disguising herself as a man for two years，Men are suffering。

They have different problems than women have，but they don't have it better。

Do you think women understand what it's like to be a man？，Not at all， no clue。

Ended up hating women because of how bad women would treat her。

She couldn't understand why women had no sympathy， had no empathy towards her。

She was a man with no status，and she couldn't understand why women didn't give a shit。

and she ended up killing herself，Now， obviously，It's a very sad story，但是它會繪畫一個我們已經知道的世界，我們會努力幫助它。
