    high school， then they go to college， they are very good in college。they nail
    their damn grades， they do their studying。they get their A''s and they ace their
    LSAT so they are smart too。。Then they go off to do their articling and they are
    really really good at it。。And then they get offered an associate position and
    they are really really good at it。。And then by the time they are 30 they make
    partner and let''s say they are in high pressure。high paying jobs。，$250，000 a
    year， $300，000 a year， $500 an hour。，Okay， what''s your life like？。You work all
    the time， period。，70 hours a week， 75 hours a week， flat out。。And you can say
    all you want about the fact that women have a difficult time with that because
    it''s a male dominated patriarchy。，Any female lawyer who''s hit 30 and has a partner
    that has any sense at all knows that''s complete bloody rubbish。，It''s market
    determined right to the core。，What happens to the women when they are in their
    30s？。They all leave the high end law firms。，Why？，Why？，Cause who in their right
    mind would wanna live like that？。'
