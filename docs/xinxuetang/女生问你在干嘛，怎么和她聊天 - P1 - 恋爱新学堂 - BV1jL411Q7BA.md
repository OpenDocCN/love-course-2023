噗~~~，Oh boy，♫wernernernerner♫，♫You know♫，♫I know♫，♫You're making up the truth♫，♫Why can't I go♫。

♫Before I lose my cool♫，♫I love you even if it's difficult♫，Zither Harp。

Don't worry just because I need to leave，Don't mean I'm sick of us， of you and me。

I'm just not good showing sympathy，Give me a break，I'm not angry anymore，Just a little bit let down。

I'm not angry anymore，Just a little upset now，I used to want to be better than I was before。

But I can't do it if we don't，But you're not angry anymore，Just a little bit let down。

I love the way you look me in the eyes，When you。We gotta stay，Zither Harp，We gotta stay，Zither Harp。
