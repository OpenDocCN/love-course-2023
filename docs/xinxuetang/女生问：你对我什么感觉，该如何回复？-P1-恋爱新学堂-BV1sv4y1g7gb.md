# 女生问：你对我什么感觉，该如何回复？ - P1 - 恋爱新学堂 - BV1sv4y1g7gb

呼~oh boy，(音樂)，You know I know you're making up the truth，Why can't I go before I lose my cool？

I'll love you even if it's difficult，(音樂)，Don't worry just because I need to leave。

Don't mean I'm sick of us， of you and me，I'm just not good showing sympathy，Give me a break。

I'm not angry anymore，Just a little bit let down，(音樂)，I'm not angry anymore，Just a little upset now。

(音樂)，Cause I wanna be better than I was before，But I can't do it if you don't。

But you're not angry anymore，Everyday I'm shuffling，感動的世界是否依然，一直不肯回，我哭了。
