    calling out such a name，I won''t say it tonight so I can keep from going insane。But
    I don''t know enough，I get some kind of lazy day。I''ve been fighting this through
    to find my title name。I''ll be stooped and moaned but I''ll leave us both the
    same，But I don''t know enough。I get some kind of lazy day，Cause it''s hard for
    me to lose in my life，I found only time will tell。And I will figure out that we
    can be better，We can do to understand。And it''s hard for me to lose in my life，I
    found outside your skin right near the fire。And we can be better，We can change
    and be alright，I''m a little used to wandering outside your brain。You can leave
    me tomorrow if it suits you just the same，But I don''t know enough。I need sun
    when it leaves the day，Cause it''s hard for me to lose in my life。I found only
    time will tell，And I will figure out that we can be better，We can do to understand。And
    it''s hard for me to lose in my life，I found outside your skin。'
