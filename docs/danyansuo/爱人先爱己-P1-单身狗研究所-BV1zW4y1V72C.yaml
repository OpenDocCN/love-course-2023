    Harp，Zither Harp，Knowing that I was going to get better。and looking forward to
    a time that I would feel good again， helped me to keep moving forward。And sometimes
    I had to be brave， and it wasn''t always easy。 Sometimes I faltered， I had bad
    days。But I realized that being brave isn''t supposed to be easy， and for me。I
    feel it''s the key way to keep moving forward。Zither Harp。'
