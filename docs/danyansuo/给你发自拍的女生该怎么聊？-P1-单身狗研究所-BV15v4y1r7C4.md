I'm a little used to calling out such a name，I won't say it tonight so I can keep from going insane。

But I don't know enough，I get some kind of lazy day。

I've been fighting this through to find my title name。

I'll be stooped and moaned but I'll leave us both the same，But I don't know enough。

I get some kind of lazy day，Cause it's hard for me to lose in my life，I found only time will tell。

And I will figure out that we can be better，We can do it， won't I stand here。

And it's hard for me to lose in my life，I found outside your skin right near the fire。

That we can be better， we can change and be alright，I'm a little used to wandering outside。
