# 你相信男女之间有纯友谊吗？ - P1 - 单身狗研究所 - BV1GW4y1L7gQ

It isn't our first time around，Past lives could never come between us。

Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up，Don't wake me， I'm not dreaming，Don't wake me。

 I'm not dreaming，Past lives couldn't ever hold me down。

Lost love is sweeter than a straw that I found，I've got the strangest feeling。

This isn't our first time around，Past lives could never come between us。

Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up，Don't wake me， I'm not dreaming，Don't wake me。

 I'm not dreaming，Past lives couldn't ever hold me down。

Lost love is sweeter than a straw that I found，I've got the strangest feeling。

This isn't our first time around，Past lives could never come between us。

Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up，Don't wake me， I'm not dreaming，Don't wake me。

 I'm not dreaming，Zither Harp，Zither Harp，Zither Harp。
