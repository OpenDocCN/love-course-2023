《一生一世》 詞曲:黃韻玲，演唱:黃韻玲，編曲:黃韻玲，演唱:黃韻玲，Zither Harp，Zither Harp，Knowing that I was going to get better。

 and looking forward to a time that I would feel good again， helped me to keep moving forward。

And sometimes I had to be brave， and it wasn't always easy。 Sometimes I faltered， I had bad days。

But I realized that being brave isn't supposed to be easy， and for me。

 I feel it's the key way to keep moving forward。Zither Harp。
