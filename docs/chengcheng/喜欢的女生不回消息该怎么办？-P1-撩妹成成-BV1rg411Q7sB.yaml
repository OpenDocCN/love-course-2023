    him into his chambay， the car was paid to start。After he''s been hooked up with
    the one that''s on his heart，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I''ll get him hot。show him
    what I''ve got，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I''ll get him hot， show him what I''ve
    got，Carry my。carry my， no we can''t riddle my， old heart''s face，She''s got me
    like nobody，Carry my， carry my。no we can''t riddle my， old heart''s face，She''s
    got me like nobody，Papa papa her face。Papa papa her face。'
