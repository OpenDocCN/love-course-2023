(音樂)，(音樂)，I wanna hold him like tattoo and catch the blade，Hold him let him hit me， raise his baby。

 stay with me，Love can't end till we show where the coward's way to start。

After he's been hooked up with the one that's on his heart，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I'll get him hot。

 show him what I've got，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I'll get him hot， show him what I've got，Carry my。

 carry my， no we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Carry my， carry my。

 no we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Papa papa her face。

Papa papa her face，I wanna roll with him， how happy we will be。

A little gambling is fun when you're with me，Rest assured that it's not the same without a gun。

And baby when it's tough if it's not rough it isn't fun fun，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I'll get him hot。

 show him what I've got，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I'll get him hot， show him what I've got，Carry my。

 carry my， no we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Carry my， carry my。

 no we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Papa papa her face。

Papa papa her face，I won't tell you that I love you， kiss or hug you，Cause I'm loving with my muffin。

 I'm not lying，I'm just standing with my lovely gunning，Check like a chick in the casino。

Take your bank before I pay you up，I promise this， promise me，Check this out cause I'm a rock。

Carry my， carry my， no we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Carry my。

 carry my， no we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Carry my， carry my。

 no we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Carry my， carry my。

 no we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Zither Harp。

啊。
