(音樂)，(音樂)，I wanna hold them like tattoo and catch them slayin'，Hold them mad and hit me razy。

 baby stay with me，Lock 'em into a wishing well， the car was paid to start。

After he's been hooked up with the one that's on his heart，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I'll get him hot。

 show him what I've got，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I'll get him hot， show him what I've got，Carry my。

 carry my，No we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Carry my， carry my。

No we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Papa papa her face。

I wanna roll with him， how happy we will be，A little gamble in this fun with you and me。

Russian roulette is not the same without a gun，And baby when it's lumpy， this not rough。

 it isn't fun，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I'll get him hot， show him what I've got。

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I'll get him hot， show him what I've got，Carry my， carry my。

No we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody，Carry my， carry my。

No we can't riddle my， old heart's face，She's got me like nobody。

Papa papa her face。
