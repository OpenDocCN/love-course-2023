Zither Harp，Brighter than the moon，Brighter than the moon，Brighter than the moon，Zither Harp。

When the day is finally fading into a dark blue，And even the light can be brighter than the moon。

And the night is writhing and the lights are shining，But now it can be bright， oh。

 brighter than the moon，The sky is far away， doesn't mean you can't be changed。

The clouds and moon is still here waiting to be，And the night is writhing，Brighter than the moon。

Brighter than the moon，Zither Harp，Brighter than the moon。
