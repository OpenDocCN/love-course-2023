    him like tattoo and catch the blade，Hold him let him hit me， raise his baby。stay
    with me，Lock him into his chambay， the car was paid to start。After he''s been
    hooked up with the one that''s on his heart，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I''ll get
    him hot。show him what I''ve got，Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh，I''ll get him hot，
    show him what I''ve got，Carry my。carry my， no we can''t riddle my， old heart''s
    face，She''s got me like nobody，Can''t remind。can''t remind，No we can''t read a
    love poem。'
