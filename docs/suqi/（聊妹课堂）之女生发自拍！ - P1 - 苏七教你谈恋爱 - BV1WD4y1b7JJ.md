# （聊妹课堂）之女生发自拍！ - P1 - 苏七教你谈恋爱 - BV1WD4y1b7JJ

I'm a little used to calling out such a name，I won't see you tonight so I can keep from going insane。

But I don't know enough，I get some kind of lazy day。

I've been fagging and screwing to find my title name。

I'll be stooped and moaned but I'll leave us both the same，But I don't know enough。

I get some kind of lazy day，Cause it's hard for me to lose in my life，I found only time will tell。

And I will figure out that we can't be better，We can do it， won't not stand yet。

And it's hard for me to lose in my life，I found outside your skin right near the fire。

And we can't be better，We can change but we're alright。

I'm a little used to wandering outside the rain，You can leave me tomorrow if it suits you just the same。

But I don't know enough，I need sun when it leaves the day，Cause it's hard for me to lose in my life。

I found only time will tell，And I will figure out that we can't be better。
