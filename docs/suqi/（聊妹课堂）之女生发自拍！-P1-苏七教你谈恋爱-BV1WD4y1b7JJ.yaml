  text: '# （聊妹课堂）之女生发自拍！ - P1 - 苏七教你谈恋爱 - BV1WD4y1b7JJI''m a little used to calling
    out such a name，I won''t see you tonight so I can keep from going insane。But I
    don''t know enough，I get some kind of lazy day。I''ve been fagging and screwing
    to find my title name。I''ll be stooped and moaned but I''ll leave us both the
    same，But I don''t know enough。I get some kind of lazy day，Cause it''s hard for
    me to lose in my life，I found only time will tell。And I will figure out that we
    can''t be better，We can do it， won''t not stand yet。And it''s hard for me to lose
    in my life，I found outside your skin right near the fire。And we can''t be better，We
    can change but we''re alright。I''m a little used to wandering outside the rain，You
    can leave me tomorrow if it suits you just the same。But I don''t know enough，I
    need sun when it leaves the day，Cause it''s hard for me to lose in my life。I found
    only time will tell，And I will figure out that we can''t be better。'
