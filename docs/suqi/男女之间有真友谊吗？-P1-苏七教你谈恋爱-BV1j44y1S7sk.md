# 男女之间有真友谊吗？ - P1 - 苏七教你谈恋爱 - BV1j44y1S7sk

It isn't our first time around，Past lives could never come between us。

Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up，Don't wake me， I'm not dreaming，Don't wake me。

 I'm not dreaming，Past lives couldn't ever hold me down。

Lost love is sweeter than a straw that I found，I've got the strangest feeling。

This isn't our first time around，Past lives could never come between us。

Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up，Don't wake me， I'm not dreaming，Don't wake me。

 I'm not dreaming，Past lives couldn't ever hold me down。

Lost love is sweeter than a straw that I found，I've got the strangest feeling。

This isn't our first time around，Past lives could never come between us。

Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up，Don't wake me， I'm not dreaming，Don't wake me。

 I'm not dreaming，Zither Harp，Zither Harp，Zither Harp，阿酸。
