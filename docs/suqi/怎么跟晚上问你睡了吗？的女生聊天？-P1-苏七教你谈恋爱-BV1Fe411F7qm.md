# 怎么跟晚上问你 睡了吗？的女生聊天？ - P1 - 苏七教你谈恋爱 - BV1Fe411F7qm

I'm a little used to calling out such a name，I won't see you tonight so I can keep from going insane。

But I don't know enough，I get some kind of lazy day。

I've been fagging this through to find my title name。

I'll be stooped and moaned but I'll leave us both the same，But I don't know enough。

I get some kind of lazy day，'Cause it's hard for me to lose in my life，I found only time will tell。

And I will figure out that we can be better，We can do to understand， yeah。

And it's hard for me to lose in my life，I found outside your skin right near the fire。

That we can be better， we can change and be alright。

I'm a little used to wandering outside your brain，You can leave me tomorrow if it suits you just the same。

But I don't know enough，I need sun when it leaves the day， yeah。

'Cause it's hard for me to lose in my life，I found only time will tell。

And I will figure out that we can be better，We can do to understand， yeah。

And it's hard for me to lose in my life，I found outside your skin right near the fire。

That we can be better， we can change and be alright。

I'm a little used to wandering outside your brain，Zither Harp。
