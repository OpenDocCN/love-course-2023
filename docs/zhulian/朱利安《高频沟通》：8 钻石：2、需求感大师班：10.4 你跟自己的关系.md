# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：2、需求感大师班：10.4 你跟自己的关系

It is also important to examine the relationship you have with yourself okay。

 this builds on that feeling of lack right that self imposed lack and some questions to really reflect on here is what's your relationship like with you？

When we hear relationships， we always think romantic by default。

 but life is really a game of relationships right there's romantic relationships。

The relationship you have with say family members， the relationship you have for friends。

 the relationship you have with coworkers right those are all people。

 but then there's the relationship you have with work， the relationship you have with taking action。

 the relationship you have with approval， the relationship you have with money。

 the relationship you have society that everything is a relationship and the most important one is the relationship you have with yourself that's the one that's at the foundation of everything。

That's at the cause and that will dictate just how healthy。Or not healthy and needy。

The rest of your relationships will be， meaning if the relationship with yourself isn't a healthy relationship。

If it's not a relationship that's again based upon just just wholeness feeling complete feeling enough。

 then all of the other relationships will suffer this is the number one this is the the macro where the ripple effect on all the micro like we'll come into play so step one is be aware of it what's it like to date you。

Guess what you and are in a relationship with yourself， you are dating yourself right now。

 you are on a date with yourself watching me talk in this video right now you're dating yourself here。

What's it like？Right honest question， just take a five， 10 second break here。Hey。

 what's it like to date you right now listening to me in this moment？

But I imagine there's like instead of just you sitting here watching me。

 there's a second seat and there's you with yourself。

Are you a very loving understanding couple or are you one of those like old bickering couples。

 is it pretty toxic， right that little voice in your head， what's it saying？

Don't do come on like don't don't do the five10 second exercise。

 just just keep locking in to the next point， come on， don't don do that losers do that losers。

Like what's the voice saying it's the voice。Make sure you get it if you miss the point if you miss the concept it'll be over。

 you will fail maybe the voice is like who are you kidding listening to this Julian fellowa right you know you'll never succeed socially who are you kidding you know this course will not help you know courses will help you it's over for you just give up and settle。

😡，Right， what's that voice saying？Bring some awareness to it。Okay， it really starts there。

How am I like with me？Is it a fulfilling relationship？

Follow up question here what's the theme right is a relationship that's and again going back to the levels of transformation you can audit it through that right is is the theme of the relationship very apathetic right what's the point why even try right like really familiarize yourself with that voice by the way and if you're listening to this or' like well what voice that's the voice。

But really。What's the theme， is it apathetic， what's the point， why even try？

And I won't even try to fix an Indian issues you。Nothing will work for you。

Is it very victim E right set of apathy moves up to grief is it oh you know I would but it's so hard I give what you exhibit it's so hard for us oh let's just go let's just poor little me is that the voice is that the relationship you have yourself is it one to fear right don't mess up don't look like an idiot better get the approval right is it anger is it selfatt。

What's the theme Okay， bring your awareness the relationship what's the theme what comes up when you look at yourself in the mirror that's another great exercise。

 look at yourself in the mirror if you want to take it to the extreme and I know this sounds out there。

 but I'd highly suggest trying it out and just seeing what comes up look at yourself if you have a full body mirror go naked in front of the mirror look at yourself full nude and see what comes up see what that little voice says。

Right it's like a， you ugly piece of shit like what， what's the voice saying right， is it loving。

 is it criticizing like。What's it like？And your job， this is very important。

 is don't judge what the voice is saying or try to reframe it， simply take note。

If you look at yourself in the mirror you have like your phone there ready or a notepad and you're just taking notes what's the voice saying oh yeah。

 you're too ugly okay， I'm too ugly what else what else what else like collect the data around the relationship with you once you have the data you can then work on it。

Okay， I even see someone here saying I try to avoid mirrors right well there's some good data too right it's like whoa。

 well why right what's that voice saying even when you think of like oh look at it yourself in the mirror。

What's the theme， right that relationship there？You're going to have to work on it directly。

Because what we tend to do is we take this kind of indirect approach where let's just say you try to avoid mirrors。

 It's like there's all the selfattack。 then needing this kicks in and there's that fixation with the physical saying。

 well， instead of working on the relationship out of myself， let's just go get some external stuff。

 Let's just throw some money at this， All right， Let's just throw some approval at this， Did it work。

 Did it work， Let's just throw some more relationship， Some more friends at this， Did it work。

 Let's throw some more travel， I'm very needy around traveling。

 Let's throw some spirituality at this， Come on spirituality， let's throw some gratitude at this。

 I'm needy towards being grateful。😊，Nothing will work the cause is that split within self drain lack it's the relationship you have with you。

 so go through that step and take note if the voice is harsh， let it be harsh。

 simply take note and document。😊，Okay。What's it like being alone？That's another key question。

Are you good enough for you？Without anyone else。You know how we have。

I remember this growing up right like you know， you might have like say a couple friends and you know that if this one friend is there suddenly the dynamic just changes completely and that's the friend who's kind of like the more party friend good vibe friend is like oh if that friend's there。

 we know we're going have a good time， but if that friend's not there it's kind of a 50。

50 hit or miss。Right kind of like that center of attention friend。Well， guess what？

What's it like with you here are you like that with others where it's like I need to be in a relationship if it's just me with myself right I need to be out of public talking to people if it's just me with myself it's like。

What's you with yourself what comes up is it fear I'm not good enough， is it selfat。

 it could even be by the way， boredom or just so boring with me right it's a very boring relationship with yourself。

 what's it like being alone can you enjoy being alone？

Or do you have to do everything with someone else？You can also audit here。

 I've seen a lot of people who。A really run by neediness who go from relationship to relationship to relationship to relationship there's no breaks in between it's like as soon as they break up it's like immediately they're in another relationship because there's a massive fear of being alone I know people who can't even go and do different activities alone they need someone else it's like even the movies I can't go to the movies alone。

😊，How much time you spend alone， do you enjoy that time。

 do you enjoy that time as much as others when you're with others and if not， what is missing？

That's the next one， hey， what's missing if you don't like being alone， what's missing？

And reflecting on that and writing down whatever comes up right what are those things you have convinced yourself will complete you I don't like being alone because I'm missing。

More money in my bank account， I'm missing being better looking， you know。

 the relationship with me' be so much better if I was better looking。Uh， you know。

 I' missing saying I haven't done enough， I've not lived up to my potential。

 I'm needy around living up to my potential。What is missing what are all those requirements I haven't let go enough I didn't let go of everything so I can't enjoy being alone because I need to let go of everything I'm very needy around letting go of everything。

what is missing？Other questions， do you give yourself enough love and attention？Even just today。

If you audit today， did you give yourself enough love and attention。

 did you or did you wake up and were you immediately just very harsh on you。

 very criticizing towards you。Did you actually take a moment and just like？Honor yourself。

Shower yourself with some love， celebrate yourself。You know， our default is again。

 we're always looking for failures， it's like， what about your successes？

Are you understanding towards yourself？When you make a mistake， what happens， what's the default？

Stupid or okay， that was an ideal。But let's figure it out， is it this understanding approach？

Right or if you're needy， it's like you're needy stupid or okay。

 we're realizing we're needy here let's see what's up same with the mirror right I avoid mirrors well can you be more understanding。

Can you be more understanding towards yourself and how often do you do things for yourself？

Do you give yourself gifts is a very simple， have a superficial example once's the last time you gave yourself a gift？

When's last time you gifted yourself something？Okay， now。

Last time if you have trouble remembering you're like， oh don't know。

 well guess what this course alone that's you gifting yourself something。

 but ideally every single day gift yourself something doesn't have to be just a physical thing or something that costs money but like do something for you。

Even just like， hey， you know what， I'm going to go outside and just do a five minute walk just for me to hang out with me。

Are you giving that relationship you have with yourself attention are you caring for it the same way you would in the other relationship？

Right， what happens？You can say even with your family， so you have a relationship with them。

 what happens if you stop putting effort into it？healthy， authentic， inspired effort。

 the relationship suffers。Same with your friends， if you stop talking your friends。

 the relationship will suffer。Same with you。If you're not tending to the relationship you have with yourself。

That's not good either。Okay， so。Bring some awareness there， what's the relationship I have with me？
