# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：1、社交焦虑大师班：4.找到根源

The number one rule here is that when you get triggered， do a release。Okay。

 that's really once more phase three。You aren't aware， you are aware of you succumb。

 the ideal is you're aware， and instead of succumbing， you do a release。

That is ultimately how you get to the cause this here is how you will start chip away at permanently the fake emotion around social anxiety。

😡，Whenever you get triggered when it comes to social anxiety。And you notice。

 my response is disproportionate to reality。If you do a release。

 that is how you will get to the cause。That is the way to go。

 you can even use getting triggered as that's what's going to set your release schedule。

RightYou can of course set a schedule for yourself。

 but you can also just time it around when you get triggered it's like when should I release when I get triggered however。

 that is also simultaneously the time where you will want to release the least。

usually when you get triggered like again， you'll succumb to it or what people will do to try to get rid of getting triggered is you know they'll try to escape it or numb themselves to it right like say you're really angry it's like well maybe if I just yell。

 it'll get rid of it， maybe if I drink a lot， it'll numb it and get rid of it or if I eat a lot or if I watch some TV or it try to escape it。

 it'll just get rid of it。You're going to have to put your foot down and say no to the escapism。

Let's do a release instead， okay， and this is also why there is that formula action trigger release repeat action trigger release repeat this is how you use social anxiety challenges。

This is how you should also really take advantage of when you go out and get references。

 you want to get rid of that fake social anxiety， you want to get to the cause。Remember this。

 when you're triggered do a release， action trigger release repeat。

I think social anxiety challenges are great。For example， just doing that sidewalk one。

 or maybe you might go on and say， hey， you know what for the next week。

 I'm going to talk to three people a day。That could be your action。Now you have the system。

 so you have the steps in terms of okay how to do it in an appropriate way so that it's win win so that it's calibrated。

 but you might also still experience a ton of anxiety so you might leave your place and suddenly。

It just hits you well， great， if you did the action， you did the trigger。

Release and repeat and just that plus time， time and repetition。

 you will start chipping away at it and freeing yourself from it。Okay。

 that is truly getting to the cause。If that's all you did， action trigger release repeat。

 notice every time you get triggered release。Works wonders， okay， however， some subtleties。

And I know it's not flashy， that's what we want right like what about the little tip that's going to help？

Now。You think you can just fix all of that that like paralyzing fear that takes over with a little tip come back down to earth。

Okay， now some subtleties， resensitization versus desensitization。Okay， when you。

 when it comes to using social anxiety challenges， once more。

 there's the right way and the wrong way。The wrong way is when you use those challenges or you take action trying to desensitize yourself and probably a lot of you up until this point have been doing that okay when I started out I did a lot of that。

And what happens there is。This is how you can know if you if you do this when you go out you might experience that fear。

 that anxiety and what you do is you rely on all the references that you've had you're like I've done this before I can do this and you kind of try to fight against it it's like this barreling through right oh i'm kind of anxious。

Come on let's let's do it， let's fight through this and you even sometimes can like go to your your happy place or you just kind of try to withdraw from feeling that anxiety。

 just let me just go to my happy place and just barrel through and take action。Okay。

 that's the desensitization route you try to desensitize yourself on what you're feeling and this is extremely appealing because。

I mean， it is logically just a lot easier to understand very straightforward and it gets you to take action and then people think。

 hey， well the more I do this， the more I try to fight through this and go to my happy place。

Eventually， I'll desensize myself completely， right？And sadly， the answer is no。

 although it might give you that temporary result， not the result you're truly after and just temporary。

It will never。Get to the cause and like I keep saying temporary it won't last right you might have experienced a little boost doing the desensitization but here's what happens you then need to always keep doing the action to stay in that happy place to not snap back that's how you know it's not a result you want when there's that fear of snapping back and the possibility of snapping back。

It's not permanent。Right and again， I always make a joke about this what is your strategy if you're going the desensitization route is your strategy to be I'm going to keep doing this till i'm 80 and 90 years old no right you shouldn't have to rely on anything to。

Puut yourself out there right relying on progressive desensitization is the same as relying on drinks。

Hey I need to take 30 minutes of action before not experiencing anxiety。

 hey I need to do 30 minutes of drinking to not experience anxiety same thing。

 although both might give you that temporary boost it's an illusion of success。And for you。

 if you've been doing that。Guess what it's like you've been hitting， you could say。

You let's say here's the starting point what you did is you were able to jump up here real fast。

But then your caps。And you can't go further。So you're going to have to learn to do is take a step backwards to then shoot up。

And you might experience resistance doing that it's the same as if say you've been trying to work on your social skills and you've been drinking all the time。

 you get capped。And to actually truly succeed， you're going to have to stop drinking。

 but by no longer drinking， you're going to feel your results。

Drop back go all the way back to ground zero and you're going to have to take the ego hit to then build it back on a solid foundation and crush it same here if you've been desensitizing yourself。

 you're going to have to resensitize。Reist the urge of going to your happy place。

 resist the urge of fighting through and barreling through。

Reconnect with that scared you before all the desensitization。

 and then from there you get to work on it。So take the ego hit okay。

 this is about resensitization and you can audit this to bias asking yourself am I moving away from？

Those intense sensations are towards。Say go say hi to that person。Go， how did that group？

Is your action is for you to take action， let's stuff this down， let's get rid of this。😡。

Or let's just live up here， not feel is it running away from and resisting what you're feeling or is it through。

 and you can sense， is tensing or is it through relaxing into what you're feeling？Okay。And once more。

 a key exercise here， which I give people in my other coaching， which is a lot of inner work。

 is do a cold shower challenge， do a cold shower for say a month。

And the way you go about it isn't trying to battle the cold， so this is key。

 don't do the regular self help approach like let's go cold， like that。

 see how relaxed you can get in the cold。Because that will be one where those sensations of cold when the water hits your body。

Our immediate reflex is to resist you'll have it too you might go out social anxiety sensations immediate sensation plow through right so resist that urge and see if you can just like relax every muscle。

Into the cold and feel completely relaxed non clenchching when those sensations hit that'll be the approach you'll have to take when it comes to like get triggered with anxiety。

Relax into it。Okay， so again， it's all about resensitizing yourself， feeling。

 reconnecting with that and releasing versus pllowing through， stuffing down and barreling through。

You can also as a compliment to this， follow the trail of wise this is a more mental approach。

 but coupled with letting go and inner work can work wonders where you ask yourself。For example。

 let's just say， go say hi to that person and you're scared。You can ask yourself why am I scared。

 okay， this is called following the Trail of wise， ultimately asking yourself why， why， why， why。

 why？Why am I scared well， I could get rejected okay。

 so you went from I'm scared to say hi to this person why well then I could get rejected。

Why well why is that scary， why is getting rejected scary well if I get rejected right you know。

 people could see it and I might not be accepted in the environment。Okay。

 well then you're no longer accepted draw size from the environment。

 why is that better scary well then it'll then i'll be alone。As an example， okay。

 so scared of being alone。By doing this trailer of wise。And ultimately you could say keep on going。

 but like see how deep you can go really， what it allows you to do is to tap into what you're feeling on a deeper level。

 okay， you could think of it as say there's different surface level fears that we have and then there's different core fears that we have。

If when letting go， you just think about the surface experience， scared of saying hi。

 scared of saying hi， scared of saying hi。That's good。But if you go deeper and work on， say。

 fear of being alone， scared of being alone， scared of being alone。

You'll actually access that much more because that will trigger you a lot more and whatever other external situation is associated to say that fear of being alone will also be simultaneously worked on。

Okay， so I do like coupling， letting go， you don't have to do this all the time。

 but just let's see if I can go a little deeper here， why？Okay， another question is。

 when was the first time I experienced this？Right so you could be oh I'm scared to say hi to this person well can you remember another time you experienced this exact same feeling。

 what about another time， what about the very first time right you weren't born this way。

 when did this come about？And this can get you to with some of those more core experiences that might have formed that original trauma now when following the trail of wise and asking yourself when was the first time。

Don't get too paranoid like I said， and don't think that you need to remember the first time to work on it right the first time might be so early in life that you don't even have the memory like you couldn't even form a memory。

So it's not about remembering the first time because even that it won't do much good right it's like when was the first time let's just say you were able to pinpoint it the first time was。

 you know in kindergarten when this person made fun of me。

 that was the first time I experienced social anxiety。Cool， great awareness。

 but does knowing that change anything no？So that's the thing following the trail of W。

 when is the first time it just creates more awareness， doesn't solve it。

 so you don't have to remember all of that。But by doing so both approaches tend to you could say open you up to more sensations。

 so instead of i'm just scared of being rejected why why why scared of being alone might bring up more the same with oh i'm feeling this right now when was the first time it might bring up more so the goal is this。

More mental approach is only meant to allow you to access。More sensations。That's it。

 it's not about remembering。It's about what that does on a felt sensation level。

 the true work is done on a felt sensation level that's letting go。Not up here， not through memories。

 letting go and again it's not about。Knowing everything about your problem it's about solving it。

 you don't have to remember the first time to solve it and like I said oftentimes you can't。Okay。

 and then lastly here。Shut the fuck up and keep releasing。

Meaning if there's something that has been running you like that。

 your entire life right it's like social anxieties like your entire life and you're like。

 let me do one meditation， I it gone。Come back down to earth time and repetition。

 time and practice right you've been spending your entire life。In that pattern。

It's probably going to take some time to unwind it doesn't mean that you can't take action until then you should still be taking action action trigger release repeat don't use oh getting to the cause inner work。

 don't use that as an excuse to not take action， get your butt out there and take action。

But then couple that action with letting go versus getting stuck in the desensitization trap。Okay。

 this is how you get to the cause。
