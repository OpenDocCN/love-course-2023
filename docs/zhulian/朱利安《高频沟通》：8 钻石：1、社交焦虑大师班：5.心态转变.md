# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：1、社交焦虑大师班：5.心态转变

Understand that getting to the cause will be the internal。

 but it doesn't mean you can also simultaneously， like we said。

 take action or simultaneously work on the mental okay。

 as long as it's all coming from the right place and you understand how everything fits together。

When it comes to those mental mindset shifts。Step one is change your relationship with social anxiety。

This is huge okay， a lot of you could say what keeps you stuck in a state of social anxiety or even。

When you do get triggered， it really comes down to resistance。If you resist something。

 whatever you resist persists。So let's just say there's that emotion what happens is you experience let's just say there's the appropriate to reality amount of social anxiety right and you might again you're probably going to still have that after right like oh put yourself out there it might not be fully comfortable but that's good it's like a small small amount that's the appropriate amount。

But what then happens is there's layers and layers of resistance and it just amplifies through that it's the same as you know feeling bad and then you feel bad about feeling bad you feel bad about feeling bad about feeling bad about feeling bad about feeling bad it just amplifies。

Right that is what really gets us to spiral out and that's when you have to let go。

 but just mentally changing your relationship and asking yourself what if this was the goal。

 could I love this， could I love this and accept this unconditionally？

Just by changing your relationship there， the hold that it will have over you and the intensity will drop。

Huge。Right could I love this imagine again say all the videos you ever saw right I love this example all the videos all the coachings。

 all the courses they were all telling you that the goal is to experience social anxiety but what happened would you experience social anxiety you wouldn't be like oh no spiral out you'd be like yes。

 that's it。😊，So change the label around this。It's no longer something negative。

 social anxiety is good。Love it social anxiety is your friend， every emotion is on your side。

 every emotion is your friend。And this really severs。That' spiral out of control dynamic。Okay。

 feeling bad about feeling bad about feeling bad feeling scared about feeling scared about feeling scared about feeling scared。

 Okay， just sever it by reminding yourself。What if this is awesome from there identify the hidden payoff realize that there's always a hidden payoff for for why you're feeling what you're feeling Okay resistance is really one that keeps it there。

 but also。Guess what， attachment and addiction？You could be very attached to experiencing it because。

 hey， perhaps there is a core belief where you're like， you know what， this keeps me alive。

 this keeps me safe。I hey， I should be really paranoid and overthinking everything and experiencing social anxiety all the time because this keeps me safe。

I don't want to put myself in danger， I don't want to let people in。

 I don't want to trust the wrong person experiencing fear keeps me safe。That might be the strategy。

 that might be the payoff if you think it keeps you safe， of course you're going to be hanging on it。

And this leads us to the next point， this is a big one， mentally remind yourself。

 you can take protective measures out of love。We think that the only way， for example。

 to protect ourselves is to experience fear。The only way to let's just say。

 start working on your health is if you fear the consequences of not working on it。Oh。

 the only reason I would make money is if I feared being broke。We think that literally， hey。

 the only thing that's keeping me safe from being taken advantage of。

Trusting the wrong people is fear， I better always feel scared and always question everything and always be on the defensive or else。

However， this is the big one again， you can take those same action steps out of love。

 it's not just fear， it's not the thing it's a place that's coming from change the source。

 for example， you can work on your health not just because you fear whatll happen if you don't。

 you can work on it because you love yourself， your body and you respect yourself。

You can be successful and make money out of self love。

You can assert certain boundaries out of self love， out of self respect。

 it doesn't just have to be driven awe by fear。Okay， so that there tends to be a common payoff。

 but you can ask yourself， how is experiencing this keeping me safe， how is it perhaps benefiting me？

And then once you identify it。Well here you can use some mental shifts to help in the moment。

 but then you can also let go that okay that's really getting to the cause。

Next one is break the negative feedback loop， the internal always colors the external if you are someone who experiences those a lot of fear。

 a lot of social anxiety。The way it works is that hijacks your focus， your RAS。

And then you're filtering reality through that and unconsciously looking for or even consciously looking for proof。

 right things that are in alignment with that and blocking off and having blind spots to anything that isn't in alignment with that。

Okay， so let's just say you go out you're like， hey you know what I want to meet some people and you go to a bar。

You might walk into the bar and if you're experiencing oh that fear。

 the way you're going to see the environment is going to be very different than if you didn't experience that fear。

 you might be walking in and I remember experiencing this so much I would walk into a venue and the first assumption was everyone's staring at me。

 everyone's against me， everyone is judging me right now I came here alone。

Everyone's probably thinking what is he doing here alone right everyone here probably already knows each other they all seem mean。

 they all seem scary u and you project all that onto them and then guess what？

By seeing reality like that， what does it do to how you feel？It amplifies it， so I experience fear。

Filterters my perception， see scary things and distort reality into scariness。

Which makes me feel even more afraid， which hijacks my focus even more。

 which looks for scarier things， which makes me feel more afraid and it just amplifies。Okay。

 that is that negative feedback loop that will tap。You can sever that okay。

 ultimately severing it is the inner work， but in the moment you can take your focus。

 take your RAS okay re activating system and shift it onto evidence of the opposite if you experience a lot of fear okay。

 let's look for proof。That。There shouldn't be fear experience here。

Is there any evidence that gets me to question that that counters the state of fear？Okay。

 so this here you could do in the in the moment， so for example。

You could look in the environment and remind yourself hey you know what can I look for smiles and just look for some smiles on people's faces no joke。

 just something as simple as that will suddenly change it to oh it kind of disrupts the scary beings all around。

Oh， there's some smiles on a more macro level you could do look for good deeds this is another exercise I have clients do where every single day write down three good deeds that you saw。

😊，three signs of goodness in the world right， there's some proof that disrupts oh everyone's scary。

 everyone's mean， everyone's out to get me， everyone's just looking out for themselves， et cetera。

 et cetera。No， if you start looking for good deeds。There's evidence of the contrary。Okay。

 so this here is something that can really break that feedback loop， okay。

 look for evidence of the contrary。From there you can take on。The social scientist mindset。

This also really helps detaching yourself at worth。

 you could say from what's happening because that's what people do they go out and they're like well my self worth is in how well I do and how well people respond to me so if I talk to someone and they respond well。

My confidence， my self worth goes up if I talk to someone and it doesn't go well， it goes down。

And what tends to happen is they'll experience very inconsistent。

Times out times out will they'll feel great the next time out it feels terrible it's really up to luck they're like I hope today's difference and even when they go out it's really this。

😊，This game of plus one minus one where it's like I talked to one person got a good reaction plus one talk to another person got a good reaction plus two talk to someone wasn't as good minus one。

 but you're still at plus one and then you're like and then you might even start filtering for like what are some easy good reactions or some safer interactions to get more plus ones and that's really your time out is like playing this plus one minus one game trying to stay in the green as opposed to hey let's play to win let's play to meet people let's be present and not make it all about me and myself worth okay so to help with this zoom out okay letting go do it but zooming out and just mentally being like you know what？

It's no longer all about me and myself worth let's take on this social scientist mindset that's who you are you're going out and hey。

 what if you were just this social scientist and when you talk to people it's more about。😡，Hey。

 how does this go who is this person， how do I feel in this moment how do they feel what clicks versus does it make me better am I a better person did my selfworth go up no you're just going out and you're just looking at what's happening and you're analyzing the data within yourself。

 analyzing the data in terms of the actions， the responses， the people， the patterns， the dynamics。

And you're just collecting all of that， okay， just that that little social scientist mindset shift can be huge it's like。

 oh， you're just this scientist。That is one that really helped me out earlier on。

Okay where I did rely massively on accountability that's what finally got me to take action。

 but then even beyond that there were a lot of times where I'm like I am a social scientist you don't want to stay stuck in this like this is a tool you want to like sprinkle on but it does help where I'm like okay first friend first I'm saying hi to how did it go okay when like this then I said this and this happened in this heaven great next person oh that was different here here here and all your focus on patterns。

Versus you。The next one here。Do it for the reference， regardless of what happens。

There is value to be extracted from taking action， you will never。

 ever lose something by taking action。Unless your self worth is attached to it and you're like， oh。

 then I'll get the minus one。Take you out of it， you will always learn。You can't lose。

So you take action and it doesn't go according to plan， there's lessons to extract from that。

That's a great reference。Oh， you take action and goes according to plan great。

 there's another great reference。Anytime action is involved。

 there is a reference and there's value to be extracted from that reference， you cannot lose。😡。

Remind yourself of that too it's like I'm little scared to say hi to that person， hey。

 don't make it about you。You can't lose。Right， it's the same funny enough how with。

Books right a big this is something Tlo as used to say a lot a big reason people don't read is because they know that they will not。

Be able to finish the book。Right right if they look at their past very few people finish an entire book。

 by the way， so I look I've tried I dabbled around I did all these books never finish them。

 so why would I start a new why would I start a book if i'm not going to finish it that's the mindset they have and the argument was。

Well， hey， although that's not perhaps optimal， guess what。

 let's just say you were to never finish a book again。What do you think will benefit you more。

 never reading again or reading the first chapter of hundreds of books？

Wing the first chapter there's value to extract you don't have to finish the book to get value saying here why would I say hi if it might not go if I don't have to guarantee that will go according to plan what if it doesn't go according to plan it's a waste now。

There's value to be extracted。Same thing。Okay， now。The last one here， aim for anger。

 this really comes down to understanding the different levels of transformation okay this is something that I also teach where you can say there's a certain progression。

 this is the transformative scale where it goes from apathy， grief， fear， anger， courage， desire。

 purpose and love。And I take people through this。And what you'll tend to find is that when you start working on yourself。

 you will go through these phases right where every single level as you move up。

 you could access to more energy and more power so if you take say someone who takes action。

There's action out of fear， it's like， oh， defensive measures and you take action。Yeah。

 you'll take some action。But if you actually move up to anger and this is like step it up right put your foot down let's do it you'll take action but there'll be a lot more power and energy and then you can keep moving all the way up to love so one thing to get people out of fear is just hey aim for the next level up what's right about fear anger and not anger where it's screw other people it's anger where it's more of like come on let's do this let's do this keep at it it's a very self motivating selfenco type of anger okay this is where most of the selfhelp community。

Resides at right it's the hustlers， the self attack level， the self hate level。

 you don't want to stay here。But to take action right to put your foot down and say take the first action that will trigger you in the action trigger release repeat formula it can really help to step move up to anger and once more self encouragingaging anger okay the example I always give for this is so you're playing a video game。

You keep failing a level。One persons going to start spiraling down and go into grief that's victimhood and it might even look like anger but they're like oh this sucks it's too hard it's because of the controller you know screw this and what's the outcome they throw the controller down and they storm off and they might even selfat like you suck everything sucks that's not the goal。

That's what you want to avoid Another person might have the exact same experience。

 they keep failing the same level again and again and again and again。

 but every time they fail it actually motivates them they fail the level they're like one more let's go one more come on let's one more one more one more it motivates them to taking action have that approach here oh it's scary and said oh this sucks oh it's so hard come on let's go oh fear let's go。

Shoot up for that anger， okay， these are the more external mindset shifts。
