# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：4、高级社交技能-泰勒：12.5 提升你的价值

How do you raise both your objective value both so that you are at a high level and that you can have longterm sustainability with other people that are at a high value you're not just like putting all the time in like this permanent halo effect。

 But then at the same time， how do you also create a halo effect， And remember。

 everybody is gonna be SU and tell you that that they don't want the halo effect。

 Why does everybody lie and say， don't make a halo effect， I don't want you to make a halo effect。

 Why is that。😡，It's the same reason why you all want to get the chocolates and not pay 100 bucks for it。

You're like， no， no， I just still want to try the truffle chocolates with no halo effect for 10。

That's what you want， right And that's fine。 That's okay that you want that。

 But that's not gonna be well suited for the people selling the product。 So understand that like。

 you know， just like you probably you know every single person who you think is attractive。

 you just wish they'd post some X- raterated video you know。

 like say it was like Scarlet Johanen or Charlie's throne。

 And it's like you want me just to some X- rateated video， you're like， yeah， right。

 But then as soon as you see it， you don't view them in that same way。

 you put them in a different category at that point。

 they're not in they're not in that same elevated category。

 you know when there's like 10 people around them blasting it onto them。 And's。😡，Like that。

 You're not you're not gonna be like， oh， I want to marry them now， right。

 You're gonna put them in this completely different category。

 But you're still gonna say yes to the video， right。

 So every single person who you see is going want you to not have that halo effect。

 And what I now I see almost two different sizes。 Some people are paraoid about it。

 Some people I see are so addicted to controlling the frame and being in control situations that they're toxic to hang out with。

 You can't hang out of them。 it's like they're the most insecure people in the fed world。

Always try to control the frame。 You know， they could never have a real genuine conversation。

 but the other side of it is a lot of the time， say that you go out。

 say go to a bar club and you just lead with this super duper genuine conversation。

 a lot of the time the person has no investment in you whatsoever they don't want to have a super deep genuine conversation with you They don't care because you don't have that initial level value So you've got to understand where you are within that sequence of events right now a lot of people will tell you just go have that super genuine conversation right off the bat。

 Okay， go try that you're in an environment where you've got this super epic DJ。

 you've got people partying， you've got drinks， their friends are there why are they gonna cut off every single thing that they're doing like the people who they came with like if you're here at the seminar and if you flew in from say you flew in from across the country or flew in from somewhere else and then somebody walks in the door and says。

 forget about the seminar that you flew in here for and say what you're gonna do is talk to me about my depression problems outside You know what I mean being real right then。

😡，Well well then what winds up happening is you're like well that's not contextually relevant to where I'm at now right so you've got to ask yourself what is contextually relevant of value to that person which means getting out of your own head right so the problem is things like realness and things like authenticity or things like personal connection are the most real and important things in the world while at the same time the biggest excuses you'll ever see for people to be lazy to cultivate value and to understand contextual value。
