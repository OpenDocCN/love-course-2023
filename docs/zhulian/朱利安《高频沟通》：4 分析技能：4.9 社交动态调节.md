# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.9 社交动态调节

As we talked about when it comes to calibrating， letting go is what clears the lens So you see reality for what it is until you let go。

 you're going to be projecting onto them and your R is going to be hijacked by the state that runs you。

 So if someone is in a state of fear， that's going to hijack their focus， their Rs。

 which we covered as well。 and they're going to be tuning into any kind of threat and not just that。

 but they're going to find ways and project onto people in reality to so that reality matches that state So when they see。

 for example， a stranger could be the nicest person ever。If you're like， hey。

 go say hi to that person and they're in a state of fear。

 they're actually not going to see that person for who that person actually is right so take this example。

So you take a stranger。Just sitting down。Sppping coffee right。

 sitting on sipping coffee and I come up next to you， I peer next you and I'm like， hey。

 go say hi to that person。Right。Say that's the situation， someone sip in coffee， very neutral person。

 go say hi。And say before you go say hi I'm like， hey， go say hi。

 if you want a little bit of backstory about this person。

 they hate when people say hi to them right like I'm in the universe now too。

 they hate when people say hi to have them， they came out of jail two months ago for you know assault and battery they're very negative。

 and they hate when anyone asked them any kind of questions， go。What's going to happen？

With that in mind。It's going to hijack what you see right you're going to project that all onto them and you're going to be acting and calibrating in a way that is supposedly relatable to that so you're going to be like hey based on all that information what's what's relatable right where's the sweet spot and that's going to be your experience and what's going to happen because that's actually not reality say I made all that up。

Because you're calibrating to that， you're actually going to fail。And not just that。

 but because you're projecting that onto the person。

 if their frame isn't very strong and your frame is。

 they will actually adapt to that and act in a congruent way。

Which is why if you go up to someone you're like they're scary they mean， how do I adapt to this。

 what are some techniques to make make them like me and not be so mean？

One low value because you're not calibrating to reality but to projection and two。

 if they have a weak frame， they're going to start acting mean because that's what you're imposing on them。

Get it。People do this all the time， oh， they seem stuck up。Oh they don't seem very adventurous。

 but that's actually you just projecting onto the person you don't actually know so this is why letting go clears the lens so you can see reality and calibrate to a reality appropriately when talking to someone too you want to learn how to really listen to them。

Okay， empathetic listening。Meaning， stop making it all about you。

Most people in conversation and interactions。When the other persons talking， they feel like， oh。

 I can stop now。If I'm not talking， I'm， I'm just not doing， but no， no， no。

 an interaction is happening。 whether you're talking or not， you're still generating。 If。

 say why I'm a conversation and I'm talking like da story and theyre like your story。

 I'm not gonna to say here like。Pause。I'm still going to be like， you know， reacting and like， oh。

 interesting。 I'm still going to be doing and engaging without talking， right， You're still there。

So most people will pause or most people will get in their head and they're going to be like， okay。

How does this relate to me when people are usually engaging in a conversation or in any social interaction？

Even right now， right？It's always like what about me。

 what about me and usually what people ask themselves is number one。

 how does this relate to me is the first thing that goes in through their mind right even in this moment me talking。

 you're probably filtering everything that I'm saying through how does this relate to me？

And if you can't find a way for it to relate to you， you're just going to tune it out。

So you're like can I apply this what does this mean for me。

 how does this relate to my life and my situations， how does this relate to my stick points。

 what about me right me？That's the first thing。Always making it about you。And if you want to be。

 you could say socially calibrated and master not this， not just the expression side of you。

 but the connecting side of you， you're going to have to get out of that and also say， okay。

 what about this person？How do they feel what's going on there， what's the larger context。

 what's beyond just me me me。The second thing is， do I get it？

Meaning you might hear me start an idea like say I start drawing those circles right authenticity relaability and your mind might be like。

mm， I've seen those before in a video I already got this and your mind tunes it out。

These are all things that stops you listening， that stops you from just really connecting。

 greet a person。Next thing is， when is it my turn to speak？

So usually when people are in an interaction they hear all topics and they're like。

 oh I could say that about this topic， I could say that what is it my turn。

 was it my turn and they're just waiting for their turn just kind of half listening until then。

And then the other one is am I being tested and this is the the you could say the trap of again。

 the frame junkie right， what's the frame am I mean tested， but like always reactive is this a test？

Turn all these off in any interaction， turn them off， really lock in at all times。

Okay and this leads you to empathetic listening。Really locking it， not just okay， what about me。

 like a surface level， but like who's this person？Right， like even right now。Watching me。

 you should be able to read me beyond just the content。You should be asking yourself， okay。

 how does he feel right now？What's it like for him right now？

What's on his mind right now behind just the delivery of the content？All that。You should read it。

In an interaction， oh。What's on his mind oh interesting how is he explaining it Oh he linked that point to that point like that's really empathetic listening。

 also reading body language， reading everything like truly immersing yourself in the person。

And this is something that will come with time， right you can't just do it at first。

 a lot of times there's still going to be that projection， but in any interaction。If you do this。

 while not getting too lost in that where again， you start compromising your authenticity and disconnecting from you。

 but this is how you're going to develop that social awareness and be able to calibrate appropriately it' understanding the foundation right which we covered authenticity relatability and then learning how to read people all of this has to happen here going off the thing you were just saying about how we tend to project and tend to like bring our own mindsets into the world I noticed that you know there are definitely times when I'm socializing particularly with new people that I find myself doing these things。

I think the thing is that fact that I notice it， the fact that I've like cult myself and I'm like。

 oh hey I realized that I'm projecting or another good example of this is I'll like have these ideas or thoughts in my head about other people and I'm like you know what I don't I don't actually know if that's true it's not even necessary that I'm like it's definitely wrong。

 but I kind of have this like you know you think I think back from like my past。

 past trauma past experiences that create a kind of like narrative in my mind。

And I guess the question is just around how do I go about？

Changing that right so how do I go about like like I know something isn't necessarily right or it's not serving me but how do I go about like building something new right like or changing my mindsets or changing my beliefs or changing the stories so a few things。

One okay， it's being aware okay I'm projecting onto it great right and what it'll get to the cause is letting go however。

 while you're letting go you're still going to have to take action and talk to people。

And letting go isn't enough to get a perfect read for someone so it's letting go is one pillar you could say the other pillar will be time and experience where the more you talked to all these different people with a cleaner or clearer lens。

 the more you're gonna to start noticing subtle patterns right where if I meet someone new here today a total stranger based upon all the references that I've had all the people I've talked to I can find similar links off some initial tellss I'm like oh based on that they're probably like all these people I talked to here before oh they're probably like this type of person I talked to before so it'll give you some general insight so a lot of experience。

And then the other one is even with all that experience， you're not always going to be right。

 so it's like again playing battleship right you've played tons of battleships you'll be able to guess some of the strategies you could say。

 but you're not always right。If this is something that you apply once you get tons of experience when you're just starting out。

Is。Come at it with the， you could say most。Positively assumptive frames。So until you know。

 just project the best onto them but be the best way right it's like if you see someone be like， oh。

 they seem super friendly， they're super open， they love when people talk to them。

 they love me et cetera， et cetera， it's going to be the best interaction like project all that instead and impose that stronger frame。

So I'd go in and I'd calibrate to that and then adjust appropriately for some reason that's not true。

 but I'd go in that star frame calibrate to it and then adjust so it's those three pillars clear the lens。

Reference experiences will help with that so even with references you can go with the positive but if you know like oh based upon my references they possibly aren't as receptive at first as just maybe delusional protecting that all about。

But if there are no references to back that up and you're just pure unknown。

 I'll go with the most positive。Yeah like assume familiarity et ce， et cetera。

 and then calibrate back after you go into the most positive frames The other one here is track their RAs with what you say with what you do when are times where they truly light up and care or not how strong is your magnet。

Okay， what topics， what emotions you can tell just how engaged someone is， you can tell in the eyes。

 right， like if I pull up all of you here。Right some of you are like you know。

 and then I'll see some people like fully locked in， some of you aren't perhaps taking all the notes。

 I see some people like taking tons of notes like there's different levels of engagement。

There's different levels of engagement， not just in general。

 but also in terms of when you're engaged。Right， like I might say。

One thing it's suddenly you're locked in and then I change topics and you're a little less locked in right so there is once more that magnet effect that we talked about that you're going to have to follow as well at all times right that's a huge part of social calibration is like are they engaged how engaged increasing engagement losing engagement。

Now one more thing here， which we'll get to is with。These with this。

 don't get trapped to being super reactive now， this is more so after authenticity。

So this should not compromise your authenticity， this is a key point。

 it's authenticity first then relaability。Meaning being aware of this shouldn now put you in a reactive state。

It should more so be this awareness tool that helps you communicate your authenticity in the best way in the most relatable way。

Right so it's the same as like you know， hearing about letting go of the need for approval。

 yet still being aware of how much approval and not approval。

It's very different it's the place it's coming from， you can be aware of like。

 oh their RISS is very engaged， it isn't。Let me change perhaps the way i'm communicating my authenticity to make it click more that's very different than there Rs is engaged yes。

 the R isn't engaged oh no what do I do then you're reacting your screw。Okay。😊，Different。

Places coming from， one will help you， one will hurt you tremendously。

 don't get in the reactive frame here。Okay but be aware of this R and this will also teach you a lot about a person and what they care about and their currency right and you could do this on a more general level like oh someone engages more when there's say talks of business right or even on this someone could engage more when there's talks of social skills someone engage more when there's talks of spirituality needs social skills someone engage more when I suddenly talk about business context and social skills networking and social skills someone here about engage more when it's dating social skills relationship social skills right so everyone has this and based upon that seeing when people get engaged and like oh I now learn more about the person。

And the more I know about the person， the more effectively I can connect with them and interact with them and communicate with them。

So those are more macro， but then even on a more subtle level。

 it's like you'll and this is also the process of getting to know someone is you'll see when someone's engaged at say one joke but on another。

 this topic， but on another。On a second and second basis， where's their RIS？Okay。

 and how strong is that magnet， And then a big one here is。Be aware of。Pressure versus non pressure。

 I call this pressure on pressure off。 This is something that naturally happens。

In any interaction in all settings， that's how you build something， how you connect with someone。

 There is this thing where you're building。 It adds to the vibe。

 But then there are things you can do that put pressure on the vibe or take pressure off。

 pressure on。Could be， for example， eye contact if you look at someone in the eyes。

 that builds a certain tension right that puts the pressure on the interaction。If you face someone。

Right， puts pressure wrong。Closer you are to someone pressure on right versus say looking at it。

 that's pressure off。taking a step back， that's pressure off。Turning away from someone。

 that's pressure off speaking louder， that's pressure on quieter pressure off。Right。

um saying something along the lines of this old push pull， right， I love you。

 I hate you pressure on pressure rock。Right so we're always doing this。

 there's always this dance of a pressure on pressure off and a whole interactions。

 this mix of tension， looseness， tension， looseness， pressure on， pressure off。

 pressure on pressure off。Too much pressure， not good。Right if you just and people misintert this。

 they hear like strong eye contact and they meet someone and they're just like。

Always holding eye contact。That's super weird， that'll just destroy the interaction。

Right on the flip side you're like， well， not strong eye contact that'll also destroy it's both。

 it's strong eye contact look away， pressure on pressure off。

 pressure on pressure off the same with topics。Same with jokes with humor right you joke， joke， joke。

 joke， joke too much it's joke， ha ha take a step back right on off。

 it's always the dance and you'll see in people when you put too much pressure they will tense up。

Right， and they will try to do things that takes the pressure off。All right， for example。

 a nervous laughter like a laughter like yeah， yeah， trying to take pressure off， taking steps back。

 looking away， breaking eye contacts， et cetera， et cetera。two tens。

And that's where you got to take the pressure roll。On the flip side， if there's not enough pressure。

 then it's too boric and you'll see someone be like，mm， okay。you know， looking away okay。

 whatever just just not engaged and as we got to put the pressure on and it's not as black and white as I explain it here it's not as simple as I explain it here。

 this is something we're in the moment， second to second it'll be this this constant dance of riding the edge of too much pressure and the edge of not enough pressure and the closer to the edge you're able to ride the more captivating and engaging the interaction。

Okay， but this is something I'm always aware of in terms of everything I do in this moment is it。

Putting too much pressure， not enough pressure， is there the right balance？And then as you can see。

 you can also mix a match right on a more surface level。

 this could mix a match where you could put pressure on in terms of what you're saying topic wise。

 but take pressure off into the tonality。You could put pressure on topicwise。

 but take pressure off by taking a step back is you do and then another way to really take the pressure off and calibrate if you've gone a little too far because again you don't know so you're just going in authentically and if it's like oh not relatable。

Pressure off right that's where use， for example， statements of empathy something where and this is so powerful by people will say oh you know it's a little weak to say that it's very powerful because it communicates a lot of value。

 it communicates that you have social awareness that you are aware of how you're affecting and influencing other people so see I going with a joke right say say a joke someone I just meet。

And let's just say it's a joke on a topic that。Really triggers them and that they don't like right it's something I couldn't have guessed before I just go in and'm like。

 oh， you know， den the ship， I'm totally in my authentic circle， but outside of the relatable circle。

Okay。Say that were to happen。How do you then readjust to try the next sinking of the ship？

You calibrate， okay， you calibrate after the fact and you do that by being aware of their reaction and then taking the pressure off one of the best ways is using a statement of empathy。

Basically saying， hey， sorry， hey， you're saying， you're sorry， you know。

And then explaining like it's basically communicating them， you realize that what you did。

 although it was perhaps authentic for you。You realize it wasn't relatable to them and you're aware of that versus oblivious so like hey。

 sorry， you know， I didn't mean for it to come off that way。

 you know this is just how we joke from where I'm from。

That that'd be an example of the same of empath or even just hey sorry。

 you know I didn't mean it that way， you know it was it was a dumb joke so anyway。And then try again。

Okay statement of statements of empathy are very powerful and are very high value So I noticed it's kind of easier in some ways to calibrate after the fact and go like more pressure off right and do like a statement of empathy versus sometimes like if you go up and they're just kind of bored initially it's kind of harder to come back from that so how do you counter that in that case I would not do a state you could actually use a statement of empathy but I wouldn't so much there if you go in and it's not enough pressure and it's like oh that's interesting I would say something like you know its scratch that boom I would just change the topic into something else when it's too much pressure to try the next battleship you'll have to do a statement of empathy between every tri if it's not enough pressure then you don't have to you can just jump to the next tri directly it sounds like。

Having a strong frame is not necessarily always relatable or always valuable and therefore just。

You know the goal or intention of asserting a strong frame isn't always going to get you you know positive productive or you know you know desired results so is that fair to say then that just asserting a strong frame is not necessarily always valuable represent。

Yeah。It has to be a strong frame like you need both right and this is where you could take two extremes of people when it comes to social skills or just general social awareness where。

One person will be。You could say very far off on the relatable side and it's kind of like the social chameleon just always being aware and trying to adapt and click and so on and so forth right like what do I can say or do for this person。

And their frame isn't that strong， but they're playing into it。

 the other person's kind of like the oblivious like it's like this。

And it's like super song bearings like what the fuck and it's like it's like this in some situations that can actually plow through and work but there's gonna be situations where it's can be extremely low value and cringe right so you want both you basically want strong frames but that are also very adaptable frames when you go in have the fucking strongest frame but if it doesn't work don't be stubborn and double down on that strong frame adapt and don't make don't attach yourself self worth to the frames basically so you can just change them at will and always have strong frames。

Got you so it's it's a calibrated frame right an intelligent frame as opposed to just a full like blunt sort of。

 you know and an authentic frame because you never want to venture outside of that circle of authenticity Sometimes you'll see oh for it to work I got to go there but then it's me compromising myself。

Makes yeah calibrating within your authenticity and then otherwise otherwise because then you go down like the frame junkie path right where everything frame frame is everything and that's all that matters just holding frame yeah。

100% yeah， but yeah， it's a nuance it's it's both you' you'll see people in in life where on the extremes you want to be like the best of both worlds type of person。
