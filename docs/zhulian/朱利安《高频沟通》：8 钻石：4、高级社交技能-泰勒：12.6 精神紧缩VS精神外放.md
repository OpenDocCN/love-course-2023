# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：4、高级社交技能-泰勒：12.6 精神紧缩VS精神外放

You know， I he used to have a buddy。 And he， he would he was a guy who was like really shy， you know。

 really struggled to meet people hyper introverted， but a really good person。

And a thing that he added was he's really good as a chiropractor。 So what I said to him one day。

 because he's a really nice person， I said， listen。

 if you want to come and do adjustments for me and my team， you know。

 you're welcome to come and tag along what I do in field trainings。 If I do in field trainings。

 it costs thousands of dollars。 And I said， if you'll do adjustments for me and my team， you know。

 because I think you're really good at it。😊，I'll have you come along。 He wound up coming along。

 He actually wound up dating some really amazing people out of it。

 And it's not somebody who you'd expect to be dating really amazing people。

 And he started getting really， really good results。 I'm really proud of him for that。 Well， later。

 he came back and he said， listen， I just want to come hang out on the programs。

 But I don't want to do adjustments anymore。 And the problem is， what he didn't understand is that。😊。

You，And so I said to him， I said， well， why am I going to keep bringing in the program then。

 Because what he didn't understand is that。If I have a program that's limited in the number of people who I can bring on the program。

 If at a certain point， there's too many people。 So every single time that he came on a program and that was back when I was teaching about 50 programs a year。

 you know， that was at that time， that was basically about 150000 less in revenue than my business got so that I could get some chiropractic adjustments。

You see what I'm saying here， So he's not seeing it that way。

 He doesn't see it as Owen gave up $150000 so that。

 you know so that I could have a relationship with him。

 like I was actually doing because I the kind of funny thing was like me my team。

 We were always kind cheering for him because he became kind like almost like the group mascot like just watching him doing these incredible social feedats。

 like just the things that he was doing like watch him getting these incredible results。

 And it made us all really happy。 then we got a chiropractic adjustment out of it。

 which we probably be too lazy to like go get on our own。 So were happy。 You know， we enjoyed it。

 that's 150。 What's money， So we didn't care So the thing is that I didn't really care。

 But then what he said was， hey you know， just start coming for free。 I said。

 why do you want to come for free。 He said， we're friends。 You know， we have a personal connection。

 What he didn't understand was that's a lazy way to say。

 I don't want to bring any kind of value because he doesn't understand is that I've got friends that that I've known since I'm10 years old that I haven't talked to。

😊，I have children， right， like somebody like myself， I've got several kids who。

 and I try to be the best dad possible， but like no amount of time is enough to spend with my kids。

 like any minute that I'm spending not with my kids is a minute， not enough。

 in a way of looking at it， right， So right off the bat。

 why am I spending time with like a random chiropractor that I met year ago， when I'm not seeing。

 know， decades long friends。 I'm not seeing my own children know， my dating。

 life can often be pretty fun。 And so now I'm spending time with a random chiropractor。

 not with maybe somebody a great guy who I love to death。

 but like I could be spending that same time with somebody who I could be dating and having intimate situation with。

 that could be pretty exciting。 I could be out at a super amazing restaurant。

 I could be out in nature。 I could be out in nature with the people who I'm dating and my kids。

 You know， I'm saying right， I could be I could be with old school longtime friends。

 I could be working on my business itself and making more money。

 There's a million things that I could be doing。Now。

 I'm somebody where I made a choice that I want to add more value to people。

 And so because I made a choice that I want to add more value to people because I do that。

 I also have people who care about my time。's know you can see that just by the fact that I'm sitting in front of a room and people came here to get some of my time。

 So the reason why if any of you are sitting here in this room。

 if you're sitting here to listen to me part of it is because you feel that I've learned how to add value that I can make your life better if your life is here and then you come to this event。

 your life will wind up over here。 that's why you're doing that。

 So the thing is that I put a lot of effort in to adding a number of different things。

 What are those things that I spend time adding objective value I want to create content and teaching that is objectively helpful spiritually I wanted to get it to the point where I'm more present to the moment。

 elevatedlevate it spiritually。 but also the framing of it。

 learning about things like sales and marketing and how to create videos and how to create social media and so on and so forth。

 So this is what you want to understand within this idea of high vi communication is that you want to be adding value right。

It was cool with my buddy， who's a chiropractor。 was he had a simple skill set。

 It's very hard to learn， but it was a skill set that's also common。

 But what he did was I gave him a window to parlay that into getting around my group。 Now。

 by being around my group， Yes， his dating life got a lot better。 But in addition to that。

 what are some other things that you think that he might have got by being around my group。😊。

He had fun。 had life experiences of what else Go insight， Learn sales and marketing。

 How about do I have any rich friends， Did he get any referrals， So did he make money off of it。

 You see this， right， But winds up happening， unfortunately。

 is that when somebody's in a contraction in that contracted state。

 what winds up happening is that they can't see the value of referrals。

 they can't see the value of life advice， they can't see the value of cool moments with people that are operating at a high level。

 They can't see the value of inspiration。 Look， even something is simple and just say being crib like this right。

 and you're up in the Hollywood Hills， and you're seeing a view of the city and then you come up and you meet the person who owns the place or rents the place。

 then what winds up happening like what I found was you know， I'm 42 now， But when I was 22。

 the chances that I had to do that， maybe to come up to a mansion or to meet people that were operating a high level。

 I got to meet people like that。 And my brain would go， I could do that。

 So there was actual value just in meeting the person doing that because my brain says， oh， I could。

😊，Do that。 I could be like that。 I could。 I could live in a fat crib。

 I could build a multimillion dollar business。 I could become a better public speaker。

 I could learn to be better socially。 Thank you so much bro I could I could learn how to do this or that or the other thing。

 So just being around people like that。 I found to be inspiring。

 But the difference is for many of us is whether we're expanded or contracted。 So a sad example。

 somebody who's contracted， for example， will be somebody who's homeless。 somebody who's homeless。

 the only thing they want is probably a dollar or drugs。 And that's just sad， That's not everybody。

 that's not 100% homeless people。 But in most cases。

 if you meet somebody who's homeless on the street， you could be like， hey， you know， do you want to。

 do you want to， you know， I run a business， I've done over 9 figures in sales， How about this。

 We'll go for a walk in the park。 will'll have a great day and we'll talk about business。

That or I'll give you a bag weed。Right，And and of course， this can be related around mental illness。

 But a lot of it is like like， where does a mental contraction and mental illness begin to overlap Because I've been mentally contracted。

 and it kind of felt like mental illness。Anybody here ever followed that Like you just get really mentally contracted。

 And it kind of resembles mental illness。 So where is that line between， you know， genetic。

 be it schizophrenia or mental illness or whatever。 And you're just really， really contracted。

 And it's just that you're blind to it。 You don't know what that is。

 It begins to dominate you because I think we've all felt that like。

5 minutes or 10 minutes or a day or a week。 You know。

 maybe you like the worst breakup of your life and you're just like whacked out。 But then ideally。

 you come out of that versus unfortunately， it's very sad Some people stay stuck there。

 So you've got to be asking yourself， your path to greatness。 You've got to be saying to yourself。

 know， how do you add value。To the people who it is that you're meeting。 And what that means。

Is that you take time to get out of your own head and what it is that you're thinking about， like。

 okay， I'm thinking about this or I'm thinking about that。 like， I want this。

 I want that because that's where most of your thinking is coming from。

 It's basically just a bunch of things that you want。

 It's a bunch of desires you have things that you want discomforts that you have grievances that you have things that you don't have It's rarely spent on gratitude for what you do have or just being present of the moment。

 unless you've trained it to be。 So For many of us in here， we've done work on ourselves。

 So you've trained to get it to that point。😡，But that's what a lot of it is right And so what happens is that we get so stuck in what we want that if you meet someone who's physically attractive。

 spiritually attractive， intellectually attractive， somebody who is financially attractive。

 if you'd like basically learn stuff from making I don't know financially attractive know you want to learn about business from things like that your mind starts to go haywire you'll actually feel the contraction where you're high levelve people and your mind goes freaking haywire your mind starts looping and looping and looping and over analyzingly and becoming weird and you can feel yourself doing that。

 So so part of the journey of life is getting the point where you can actually begin to raise yourself up and get around other people who would inspire you or help you to raise up or help you to get what you want but you can actually add to them So what you'll find is that as you are able to add to other people。

 you're gonna see that you're able to not be as nervous around them and it becomes very。

 very normal to be around them And that kind of brings it back full circle to what I was saying earlier。

 as far as you meet somebody out within 10 seconds you're change of contact information。

 because you can energetically feel that they're very expansive and they can。

From you and you're like I didn't even know what this person is doing。

 but they're doing something cool。 and I can learn something from them or just being around them would be elevating。

 So let's trade information。 know and you're gonna see that's just going to tend to happen more and more as you move up the food chain。

 Now is the social interactions that you have the key to everything。 No。

 it's one key among many parts of your life。 It's just an area that we happen to teach you the high level because you worked on it for a very。

 very long time。 There's many different areas and mentors and and things to work on and so on and so forth。

 But this is a very， very important part because the truth is you become like the people who you hang out with。

 you start talking like them。 you start thinking like them， you start behaving like them。

 you start raising their standards or lower into their standards。

 That's the real truth of a lot of this stuff。 It's just one of those things。

 This is the thing is that what most people are doing is they're making offers that mathematically。

 the average person cannot say yes to。 They can't say yes to your offer。 They physically cannot。

 you are putting them in a bad position by even making the offer。

 you're putting them in an uncomfortable position。 So you want to think of it like。Okay。

 so say that I'm doing a party up here。And I say， hey。

 I'm gonna to be doing this really awesome party。 And then what。

 whatll inevitably happen is some of my guy friends will come and they'll say， oh， could I come。😊。

And I'll say， how many girls are you bringing and they say， but we're friends。

Why do I have to bring girls， we're friends？Right， and I say because if you don't。

 because it's always easy to get men to come to parties， right， every man wants to go to the parties。

 right， because they have less invitations， But， you know。

 attractive women have often more invitations。 They have more options and things to do and less incentive to go。

 So as a result， it's always the challenge to bring up attractive women to a party。 and it's very。

 very easy。In my experience， anyway， to get men to come out to a party。

 I I can get 10000 men to a party tonight。Okay， so then they say I want to come， I say。

 what girls are you bringing， and then they always say， why I don't need to bring a girl。

 But what they don't understand is if I said yes， by virtue of me saying yes to them。

I have an equal male friendship with about several thousand other males。

Therefore I'd have by an extension of that logic， I would also say yes to the several thousand other men that I know and then the party and look it's one thing if it's a seminar。

 but it's another thing it's a party and basically the party would be a big group of men and then by virtue of that。

 you wouldn't want to be at that party and you'd complain and say that I suck and say that my party suck because there's no girls there。

😡，So by me saying yes to you， you will hate me。😡，The offer that you're making me， you will hate me。

 Probably not hate。 But you know my point， right， you'll be like， don't go to Os parties。 man。

 those things suck。😡，You know， I asked him if I could come。 He said， yes。Add was a bunch of dudes。
