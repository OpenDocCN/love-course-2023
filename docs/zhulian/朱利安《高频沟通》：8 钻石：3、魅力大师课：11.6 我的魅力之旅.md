# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：3、魅力大师课：11.6 我的魅力之旅

When it comes to my own journey with charisma， okay， a bit of the behind the scenes。

 I'll break down really how I came into my own and take again the underlying principles that you can apply to you。

Okay， so I did exactly what I listed out here I reflect back on my life it's like what do I find funny and I just made a log right I wrote down for example all the movies I resonated with whether there it was movies that made me say laugh。

Movies that made me experience some carefreeness and movies that made me just tap into a lot of passion。

Right so for example， one that made me laugh was bo at right not so much the recent one。

 but like the old school one。Absolutely loved it it hits on so many things from the humor to just really like pattern interrupting society playing with social conditioning was amazing so that was one right I could also think of you know。

 for example， into the wild had a big influence on me too that really hit on the passion inside and just also the carefreeness it just like hey just follow your dream to you there's you could say that the movie the doors right centered around Jim Morrison。

Exaggerated a bit， but loved that movie as well hit on the passion side hit on music。

 so I really made a log right fun carefree passion， what falls into it。

Looking back in my childhood even as a kid， what did I like watching， what were the jokes。

 what was the type of humor， what were the types of type of music that I was in。

 what were the role models， the people I looked up to。

 what was the clothing style that I was in and literally making this really deep log okay so that's reflecting on your past。

I also did what I told you to do here， I would audit on a day to day basis。

 things I said or did that I found funny。Even situations I laughed at。

This is also where that podcast exercise comes into play right it's like every week you gotta fill a podcast you better start training your focus your IIS to pick up on stuff right like even this week。

 what were the top three things this week that made you laugh like crazy if you don't know that's not good okay so I made that list categorized it all saw the different themes and could then just really break down what makes me tick okay so when it comes to for example humor like what's my style of humor how do I generate it it really falls into what I wrote down here Bora Nathan for you or even walking Phoenix in the movie I'm still here right one of my favorite movies absolutely love it what do they all have in common。

It's really this inside joke with yourself。That's a big foundation of it it's like this kind of like half prank inside joke with yourself and you're involving others that's what Bora was right messing around of social conditioning in a way that's what Nathan for you is same thing it's like what is like out there kind of inside joke and social experiments same with walking Phoenix right the whole movie I'm still here is him ultimately quitting acting and pursuing rap career right and the most crazy debauchurous way where he gains a ton of weight he has a beard he's writing these terrible rap songs and everyone thought。

I can spoil it now because it came out and everyone knows like you know he's back to acting but at the time he didn't tell anyone about this and it was I think it was like a year or twoy project where he'd go on talk shows I think was like what David Letterman or something and he was on there and they're like why are you quitting acting and everyone thought he was quitting acting everyone thought this guy was insane he's like showing like he did his music and stuff he did a concert he would get in fights with people and then in the end he was like oh yeah well it was actually a whole movie。

 a documentary that they filmed and then it's the whole movie so his movie was him acting but in real life like playing into the persona that is him。

So all those things I love right so like that's my topic here or anything that links to that right having this inside joke with yourself。

 also deviating from what I call the anticipated script。Right。

 where in society there's always an anticipated script， you know that if you go to。A restaurant。

 for example， there's a script that people will follow right it's like you know they're gonna ask you this like oh would you like。

 would you like a desserting thing to drink with that dish should I give you a couple minutes with a menu like you know there's a script you know if you talk to someone and you're like well what do you do and they tell you their job and you're like what's that like you can pretty much guess what they' they're going to say there's always some kind of anticipated script。

I love messing with it stretching it right so what would be an example of that say。

I were to meet someone out and it's just a fun social setting。

 not serious at all and someone asked me oh so anyway palry。

Right two answers that I mess around with for a while that I found so hilarious one was that I would tell people I'm 18 no'm this was in Europe I'm 18 in Europe I'd be 21 here so say it's here in America I'm like'm21 just turned 21。

And I would obviously look a lot older。And then just that it's not an answer that people would anticipate right because they could obviously tell I older than 21 so like wait a minute。

 21 and then I would stretch it so I'd be like， oh， I'm 21。

Just turn 21 today actually it's my first time say it's in a bar setting it's my first time in a bar this is so exciting I everyone't remember be like what are you serious it's like yeah is it your first time too it's so crazy and then I'd like exaggerate I'm like yeah you know it's it's everything I thought it would be I've been looking forward to this day for a long time it's like it's so over the top again kind of like Bora and Nathan for you that people are like。

This can't be true is a serious word and in the meantime what is it doing it's me pushing mountain buttons I'm laughing like crazy and then I'd be like oh I'm just kidding and I tell them I real age right so again I wouldnt drag this on long and be like you know 10 seconds or so and then tell my real age and I'd find that hilarious and they would laugh and everyone would laugh the other one would be oh yeah you know I'm how do you。

😊，OhI'm 48。And obviously they're like what you 48 I look a lot younger and I'm like yeah Botox you'll learn about it when you're older it's like wait what it's like no one expects that right it's nowhere are you going to anticipate a way age followed up with oh yeah so much Botox because no one would even admit to like doing Botox like you'll learn about it when you're older。

If you're like， wait， what old it was？I'm like， yeah， you know， I'm here because。

My daughter actually turned 21 she's at the bar over there they're like what are you talking about yeah it's and then I would just stretch up'd be like yeah you know it's crazy kind of bore at humor yeah you know we came out here for 21st birthday but she's just been sleeping around like crazy and I wanted to save money so we' got this room where it's two beds and it's just guy after guy in the bed next to me and。

I don't know how I feel about that as a father， but you know。

 I kind of learned to enjoy it in everyone' like， waitt， what just kidding， here's my real。

Right stuffuff like that and once I understand that about myself， guess what， give me any script。

 I can get creative now and I love the process like how can I get creative and stretch it and tap into this kind of boat inside joke with myself messing with social conditioning。

that's something that I find funny and I'm extremely passionate about even my job is hey unplugging people from social conditioning。

 letting go of negative social conditioning。That's me。

Right and then another one here as I wrote down is recreating different movie scenes or TV show scenes right where I'd find it super funny if there was a scene。

 you know we talked about the vampire Is I'd watched them and there was a quote I think it was like something like that's the beauty of eternity or something like that this can be our defining one we have time。

It's beauty of eternity and I remember seeing that as like oh that's such a cool cheesy line and I would just start slipping it into all my interactions right it's like oh yeah you live in LA and I'm like that's the beauty of eternity and just like just continuously saying it I would just find that funny right or if there's a certain vibe or things like I would just bring that in my interactions that is really breaking down again how to push your buttons how to amplify that。

😊，So much of it。Question for you is what is your version of that？

Do you know your humor inside and out doesn't have to be this right I have friends who their humor is maybe like just a lot of just。

Movement and I friend it was like just screaming and being loud and just kind of movement kind of like goofish a bit more the goofy side humor。

I have some other friends who guess what their humor is actually being a little bit more serious and going like kind of intellectual。

 but for me this is it's this and there's a million ways no a million ways。😊。

To bring this into interactions， no matter who I'm talking to。At any point。

I get to stretch it and stretch it and stretch it and you get creative enough。

 you really become invincible Okay， so this here is really how it came about for me and the process that everyone has to go through right sitting down and like okay。

What's unique about me？What do I find funny， how do I press those buttons， how do I express it？

What's that caricature version of myself？For me， it's this。Find yours。
