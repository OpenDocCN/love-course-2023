# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.6 换框

There is such a thing as frame battles。And reframe right and this is something that you may want to just get a feel for as a training wheel and then just let it unconsciously happen but。

You know if you agree upon that shared reality sometimes it's very easy right sometimes there's some one who's very high value。

 very low value and they just adapt to a high value but sometimes it's very close or people test each other try to you know assert a certain frame and you've got to be aware of that and aware of the shifts and the dining I saw an interview with child Peterson where the interview would try to reframe。

All his answers into something that he so he seemed bigoted or。

Something in that kind of vein and is morally the person who is lower。

And if someone is trying to do something like this to you， how do you react do you just leave。

 do you overpower them or how if you do， how do you do that or？

You could ignore and keep going like the most let's say the most important rule is don't emotionally fly into it and feed it that's the key so if someone throws something like that at you and people can sense emotionally that it threw you off right you're like and you're reacting because that's thing like they' throw frames and try to get you reactor poking and if you do react so say someone's like Jordan Peson you said that and what if he's like oh shit no I didn't he's trying to explain himself he's already thoughted because he reacted to the frame。

But if emotionally you're grounded and it doesn't throw you off and from that point like that's the foundation that's the win。

 then you could do like how he said where it's like look that's not what I said what I said is good and then he goes in his interview。

 but you can sense like。You don't see that emotional shift within him， he's not thrown up。

So that's why in that interview is like just he just goes the logical route。

 that's not what I said this is why I said b twicey off again that's not what I said this is why I said that like that's his approach。

 which works， but again it's because that foundation is hes not shake。Um。

 but in in any other situations， once more， you could change the topic， you could even technically。

 if you want call out as long as it's proactive， not reactive。

You could set a new frame or you could just show how that leads into what you were going to say anyway so on and so forth。

 right， but it would be the same as save。You know， say right now you say something like。I'm like。

 by the way， Nicholas， are you where are you right now， what location are you in？

Where do you live right now in this moment， where are you in the world， Altingan in Germany？Oh。

 did you say in Germany because you were trying to qualify yourself。

 you don't have to qualify yourself， man。No， I was just we didn't have to hear Germany。

 did you assume that we were so dumb， we didn't know that was in Germany？Yeah。

 is that why you tried to say Germany？Yes， now what am I doing and I'm imposing a framenk？

You were just casually answering I'm in this place in Germany。

Now notice how that can be interpreted in many ways for other people oh and awesome that's great。

 but notice I impose the frame one you're qualifying yourself because you're adding that detail and you're assuming we're dumb and we wouldn't know it。

Now， if you then by into like you did like， oh， no it's not what I was say you're already fuck because you just validated my frame。

The way to pass this is not even let it phase you to the point where you don't even。IUltimately。

 almost not even notice it or if you do it' very briefly and just keep on going like it's nothing it's like a little fly。

Give attention to the fly。The fly will transform into giant human hybrid of a fly and eat you。😡。

Ignore the flight。Yes。Right， all right， now that was a little try hard too。But thank you。

Why did you have to interrupt， why did you interrupt me？

Because I felt it was you already talented it shit。

Ive got to did it right so it's like there'll be so many settle layers like this and don't ever if any of you felt attack and you fall into like you're going to fall in so many frames。

 you're going to feel for it and then you'll fall into the trap of being overly paranoid about frames and that'll actually hurt you because if you're too paranoid。

😊，The reason I hurt you is you still buy into it， even though you have the right answer to it because you're buying into your font。

So that's why it's like the most grounded you can be， the less effective。

 the less importance you also place upon what people say and frames in an authentic way。

 the less you'll be reacted right so again it's all a big joke the more you do the inner work。

 the less you're triggered by frames because it tends to play on things that trigger people。Um。

All of that will be game changers in terms of communicating value。All right，嗯。

Did you have to say all right？No。Okay， so notice that yes sound right。

 pause you can see the emotional record， no。What if you're just like， what if I was like， okay？

Here's a great way to pass it just answer logically。

 but don't react did you have to interrupt if you're just like yeah。You'd actually win。

You would have actually used that as an opportunity to demonstrate value。

Did you have to interrupt me， Yeah， I did。Did you have to interrupt with me， no I didn't。

But emotionally grounded your memory。Did you have to say okay right now？Yes。

Okay better there's still the positive oh yes， but like it's that there like people overthink what's the perfect response if you were just like yeah。

And just owning it grounded。you don't fall into it， so that's things like people throw it。

 don't fall into it， only validate and buy into the ones that are beneficial or mutually beneficial。

Does that make sense？Absolutely。Are you just saying that or do you actually mean it？I mean。Really。

 I feel like you're being fake， but maybe that's just me are you being fake？

That's you seem like a got， you're pretty smart， right？Yes。Okay。Do you study a lot。

 you have degrees or anything？Not really， I'm going to goum and you're not going to qualify yourself。

 it's okay， I was just being nice。Poite， I don't really care about the answer。All right。Okay。

 now here's another good ones like， okay， try to react like， okay， you're going with the all right。

 yes， yes， grounded， great。You can also throw it back。Throw it back at me。

 throw it try like when someone throws a frame at you。

Pat like don't buy into it but then you can throw another one back right where it's like say you say something I'm like oh don't have to qualify yourself。

 you can throw about like well aren't you qualify yourself by asking me， you know。

 if by saying don't qualify yourself， you can then impose a new one like maybe I'm qualify myself by saying don't qualify yourself。

It's always a frame there's always a frame upon a frame upon a frame and upon a frame。Jesus Christ。

That's that's getting too mind gamey for me it's a deep dive in the matrix。

 but once more it's like that there's the sprinkle of spice on the steak the steak is unreactive back to you back to your plan not thrown off because that's what different frames will do what people try to do is or especially if they see you because people also get jealous right like here in an interaction as a group and say suddenly unique class like say you start stepping it up and your fun carefree passion and suddenly everyone's on you。

Some people might be jealous and some people are like， fuck this back on me。

 give me the fucking magnet back on me and then they might throw some stuff at you。It's like， oh。

 do you think you're so cool？And they try to frame it where now instead of you expressing yourself in something you're interested in。

 it's like， are you just trying to impress us or are you saying that because you think you're better than us right。

 frames thrown at you？And that there is like every time you just oh no no。

 just keep on going or misinterpret or joke or flip around or make it as part of the plan or even use it to disqualify so you can link it to the bullets we talked about right where it's like hey you don't have to qualify yourself be like yeah。

 I do that all the time I just suck you know I'm just this person who' is always qualifying now it's part of the plan。

Now what I said actually fed your frame。So notice how you can make if you're creative enough。

 an imp brain feed into your frame。Okay。😊，Let me just open the chat here。

 but otherwise round of applause because I was it I'm very good I it' be and intense but I hope you at least like everyone's seen this and especially you feeling it like you gotta feel for what it's like like someone suddenly throwing this or this curve and like the game of frame so it's like for now just bring your focus to it over time you'll get a feel through references。

 this is a dynamic that's present in any interactions all of them。
