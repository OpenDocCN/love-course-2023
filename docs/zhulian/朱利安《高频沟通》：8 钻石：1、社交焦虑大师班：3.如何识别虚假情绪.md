# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：1、社交焦虑大师班：3.如何识别虚假情绪

How to identify fake emotions， Okay， so fake emotions。Is ultimately when you get triggered。Okay。

 and you could be triggered in terms of duration and intensity。Okay。

 so the questions you want to ask yourself is。Is my response appropriate to reality。

 This is a question I ask myself。Almost every day， if not every day。

I want to say six days out of seven。Okay that's how often I ask myself is my response appropriate to reality this is an audit it's an audit to see am I being triggered right now am I experiencing real emotions or fake emotions so if we take that example of say public speaking。

If you're freaking out like crazy and you just try to objectively zoom out and look at the situation。

Hey， is that an appropriate response if you were to you know show the situation and your reaction to it to a thousand different people and you're like。

 give me the answer， is it appropriate yes or no what would be the consensus right what would the majority of people say？

In that case， not appropriate to reality。Okay， the same with， for example。

 putting yourself out there socially。take this situation because this tends to trigger a lot of people。

 say you're in line at a Starbucks right or a coffee place and it's really quiet。

 you're just waiting in line， everyone's on their phone， there's no music。There's this big line of。

 say， 15， 20 people， and you're right in the middle。Would you？

Feel comfortable right in the middle there， just start， you know。Singing。Just start singing a song。

Guaranteed， probably a lot of you just the idea you're like， oh no， no， no， no， no， no， no。

Right another example that triggers people and I have people actually do this in some of my live events is you go out in public。

 okay， so people go out in groups of four。😊，And what they do is you find a crosswalk。

One person goes on the other side， the three others stay on this side。

 and the person on the other side for two minutes has to yell out across the street to the group the lessons that they learned。

Okay so this is a busy crosswalk so you're just standing there by yourself the groups across the street the three people also pretend like they don't know you so they're all like looking away so it's you alone people are waiting next to you and out of the blue so what I learned today is for two minutes of course people are going to stare right and it has to be loud so the group here and it's nonstop if you take a break that's longer than five seconds you start over to get two minutes straight。

That they just the idea， people are like。Oh no， right。

 extremely triggering and it's just really intense。😊，If you audit the amount of fear there。

 does it make sense， is it appropriate to reality， no， okay， depending of course。

Where you live right， if it's a super dangerous and if you do that you could die then maybe。

 but in most cases， 99。9% of cases， what's the worst case scenario， you just get some stairs。

That's it right or someone might ask you how， what are you doing you're just like， oh。

 just a social anxiety challenge。Done， that's it。That's really the worst case scenario maybe someone will be like oh can you tone it down a bit worst case okay。

 just tone it down or just do it again at another crosswalk。

You shouldn't be experiencing that much fear for that。Okay。

 so you want to be auditing this in terms of intensity， like I said， and duration。You might。

 for example， get really。Angry about something right maybe you're driving and someone cuts you off in traffic and suddenly you're just like God。

 you're like screaming in the car and then your day moves on。

 people will still experience the anger from that situation a couple hours or a few hours after it happens they might even experience it the next day the next day they wake up and they're like there's that little flash the pops up in their mind we cut off in traffic and they're still experiencing that anger at there that's not an appropriate response Okay you shouldn't experience it for that long。

 the same with the breakup right 40 years later， no， no， no。

 not good So whenever you catch that a response that is disproportionate， that is a fake emotion。

 that's one that you want to like go of。That's what you want to process， so always be auditing。Okay。

 ideally， the answer is yes， it is proportionate but。

Find the data so every day it's like how do I feel right now is how I'm feeling appropriate to reality。

 even on a more subtle level right like say during this。Speech here， right。

 say listening to me in this video here。Is there any reason for you to？And I feel great。

In the present moment， right is someone next to you like punching you in the stomach or something no？

So if you don't feel grades， perhaps even that， right not experiencing peace。

In a situation where externally it makes sense to experience peace。

That is also a disproportionate response to reality。

or not feeling proud when you accomplish something a lot of people when they even accomplish something that's immediate selfatt。

 what they could have done better so on and so forth， hey if you can't let that land。

 if you can't celebrate yourself in a time where it does make sense to celebrate yourself。

That's disproportionate to reality。Okay， so that's the first question to ask yourself to identify fake emotions。

The next one is， is there a specific reason for what I'm feeling？

Is there a reason can you pinpoint why you're feeling what you're feeling？

So going back to say the beeping like example in the car。If it's beeping and I see， oh。

 a car pulled out in front of me， then there's a reason。ButHey。

 what if there's no card that just starts randomly doing？That will happen。Okay， is there a reason？

And if you can't find the reason， if it has nothing to do with what's out there。

Then it's something inside of you that's getting poked at， it's you getting triggered。

 it is fake emotions。Okay， so you' ultimately with these questions auditing。

 is my emotional guidance system working？Is it activating what it needs to activate。

 is it activating the right way， the right amount of intensity？

And the right amount of like duration for how long it's activated。Okay， is there a specific reason？

The same is maybe you might just be sitting at home and suddenly you feel really stressed for no reason and you can't even pinpoint you're like。

 why do I feel stressed？Well， hey， if there's no reason why you're experiencing it。

 that's not appropriate to reality either。Okay， so that's the next question and the third is am I in control？

This really goes hand in hand with the intensity where when you do get triggered and experience those fake emotions。

It tends to hijack you。Right， so in terms of identifying this， there tends to be。

You could say three phases that people go through number one is they have no idea when it's real or when it's fake they have no idea when they are triggered or not they think the entire time this is just me。

Even in an argument， they might just snap you've probably experienced this like people just just get really triggered and snap and they'll either snap in terms of being just very like like fighting back like go out like yelling at the other person or they'll snap in terms of just like shutting down like well screw it and just walk out the door。

 drive out and just leave。嗯。😊，In those moments there。

A lot of people don't even know that something took over and you'll also notice after the fact is actually another interesting tell when you do get triggered or experience those intent like really intense like takeover。

Like feelings。After the fact， you will always experience a little bit of。Guilt in a way。

A little bit of shame and embarrassment and a little bit of like oh is that right the same type of feeling you might have where maybe you're someone who just goes out and see you had a crazy night out you had a lot of drinks and the next day you're like oh to help everything what is that right that doesn't even really feel like you same thing is when you get triggered you might have that you snap you say some stuff and then the next day you're like oh why did I say that to that person Oh I shouldn't have said that。

That there is when something really takes over like it has control over you so most people step one is they aren't aware。

Step two， this is the second phase is they become aware but the poll is still too strong right it's like you get cut off in trafficked like you know you're triggered but you just can't do anything about it and you just succumb right or you're in that argument you know you shouldn't be saying that but you can't help it you're still say it anyway。

That's phase two and then phase three is you become aware of it and you're able to resist the pole that it has。

😊，And instead in that moment， perhaps work on it by doing a release and freeing yourself from that Okay。

 but that's really it in terms of your real emotions。

 you'll always be in control It's your system saying here's here's the message。

 here's the data Thank you versus I now。Am you。Okay， so how to spot it。

 these three questions and once more it comes down to am I getting triggered？
