# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.8 真实性+关联性

This next page here。Is extremely important。When it comes to the analytical side。

 everything really plays into this。Okay。Authenticity。Plus。Relate stability。this is authenticity。

 this is relatability。When it comes to socializing in any aspect， always be yourself。

 always be authentic。Never， ever compromise your authenticity。But as we talked about。Being yourself。

But also making sure that it connects。Expressing it in a calibrated relatable manner so that it's a win win Anything within this circle is you being congruent Okay。

 we talked about this thoughts， words， actions aligned and don't get too myopic with this idea of congruency right we think that there's only one thing at any point in time that we're congruent and that feels authentic to us right at this point in time。

 I just want to clap my hands that's the one thing that's maybe authentic but that's not true There's actually a million things that you can be doing at this point in time that are also authentic to you Okay。

 don't get myopic don't get stuck on one thing there are a million。And your job in an interaction。

 whether it's a person， a group you name it is to always act within that circle of authenticity。

 never， ever compromise it for any reason at all。But。Because an interaction is not just you。

 it's not a one person show， right parts of your intention should be to also make it relatable to the person or the people you're interacting with。

So it's always authenticity plus relatability and the key is finding。The sweet spot right here。

 the overlap。That's where you want to be operating it。

Because if right now you're just operating on the authenticity side and it's not relatable。

 it's a win for you， you could say now going deeper it's actually not because your intention is to also connect to the person or people。

 but you could say it's a win for you but it's a lose for whoever's talking to you say you were to meet someone new right？

And you're in the first couple minutes of talking to that person。And you tell yourself， hey。

 I'm gonna to be authentic。 And you start telling them all your baggage。

 all the things that happen you and your childhood like all just unloading on the person， right。

Is that you being authentic？ Yeah， you're like， yeah being authentic。 Is you being aate relatable no。

So that's acting， if you will， within this circle of authenticity。

 but outside of the circle of relatability。 Now， on the other side。

 sometimes you'll find people who compromise their authenticity for relatability。

 And this is the people， pleaser， right？ It's the， oh， you know， what do they like。 Let me not。

 you know， I want to say yes。 but let me say no to please them。

 And you would think that it's a win for them and they lose for you， right， That's lose win。

But as you know， the rule， if it's not win， win， everyone loses。So you must find the sweet spot。

And the way you do this is simply by playing a game you've probably played during your childhood called battlettleship。

Right where whenever you talk to someone or a situation and we're gonna go deeper on this like there are some tellss that'll give you a general idea of where this sweet spot is。

 but then from there it's you just really trial and erroring it where just like plain battleship you got to guess where the ship is you want to sink the ship you got to guess right so Sam I'm talking to someone。

I know， okay， based upon what the gist of what I feel from this person or what might have been introduced。

You could say contextually to me prior to talking to them。

 I know that they might not resonate with this type of extreme humor right this is something I always do because again my humor is pretty out there。

So I might know okay oh this is a little too far out there for them so i'm just not going to start there I know the ship's not there i'm not going to sink the ship there。

 but maybe it's around here， so I might say a joke that's very authentic to me。

But that somehow for some reason isn't relatable to the person。

 so it's possible that you start here right you try to find the ship and you mess up。

And we'll talk about this then you'll have to calibrate and what people do is they just really commit to and get attached to that course of action or that joke where instead of being like you know I do the joke oh it's not relatable let me change courses of action they just keep on doubling down and that's the terrible approach I'm going be like oh the ship's not here let me try something else how about this still not there how about this still not there Oh there it is and I find。

The sweet spot so you will have to play battleship sometimes you'll do it and you'll hit the sweet spot awesome sometimes you'll have to calibrate and work your way there。

Okay， this is once more the foundation when it comes to social awareness now a couple things here。

Sometimes。No matter what， there won't be any overlap。Hey。

Sometimes you're going to try to find that ship and try to find that ship and try to find that ship and there is no ship to sink。

And that theres when you are interacting with someone you're simply not meant to get along with and that's one of the big lies that we've all been conditioned on which is you should get along with everyone and everyone should get along with you。

 but that's going against nature and it's not normal right all of us here if we all hung out there's gonna to be people in this group that you get along with more than others and it doesn't mean that the people you don't get along with you don't like them it just means that there is no natural chemistry。

Okay， and that's where it's， hey， nice to be you， not meant to be with this person。

 not meant to talk to this person， not meant to be friends with this person。

 not meant to work with this person， whatever it is。Okay， this will happen。

And a big trap people fall into when this happens is they self attack over it。

 they think that it has something to do with them and that they got rejected and they takes a hit on their self worth and that is。

Deillusional， okay， no， a lot of times a quote unquote rejection is simply you。

Meeting someone you're not meant to be with。And you should be happy， right， you find that out sooner。

The only way to be with this person or to connect to this person is to compromise your authenticity and to be a people pleaser and that's terrible。

Okay， so do keep this in mind。 This will happen， but also understand that this sweet spot is not static。

 There are three things。That you could say， expand it。Number one， is value。The more value you have。

The more。The sweet spot will expand。And the more of your authenticity， you can let shine。Okay。

For example。Say in a work setting， an employee says a joke that's a little out there。

It will be less relatable to the other employees， maybe some will laugh。

 but they might hold their laughter in because it's not that relatable than say the boss made that exact same joke。

 If the boss did it because they have more value， it's more acceptable。Right it's more relatable。

 the same way where if you take a rock star celebrity。

 they could wear crazy things and you're gonna be like， oh， well， of course。

 versus your average person in the street。😊，Aver person in the street， probably like。

 what are they doing Now， that doesn't mean you can't do that If you were to actually say。

 talk to that average person in the street and they had a strong reality， You'd be like， of course。

 because now you know them。But I first glance a little bit less than the ce。

Value expands the sweet spot。 Comfort is the second one that expands the sweet spot。

 We took that example of unloading your baggage， right， At first， it's not appropriate。

 But say you spend a lot of time with that person。 There's a lot of comfort。😊，Maybe a few weeks。

 maybe a few months。 Now， the sweet spot actually grew where it is relatable to start opening up。

 say about your personal life or your baggage or whatnot。

So value and the more effective you are at also displaying that and communicating your value。

 the larger the sweet spot。Comfort， and then the last one is。Environment， context。

Where say we take that work setting， say you're with a bunch of coworkers and you make a joke。

 they might be like， oh， it's not appropriate for the work thing I don't know。

 but say you were to now move environments and you're hanging out with those same colleagues outside of a work setting。

The sweet spots a lot larger。Same people， same situation， just a different context。

 a different environment。So value， comfort， context in any social situation， any situation in life。

 always ask yourself what's the context， that's the first question you should ask yourself right what's the context meaning。

If you're in a conversation， whether it's with one person or a group， ask yourself。

 what's the context of number one this conversation？What's appropriate to this conversation？

If you know， I were to jump into a conversation and everyone's talking about say stocks and investment。

 and suddenly I'm like， hey， by the way， you ever hear about letting go。

 it's not appropriate to the context。Get it like there's a certain established topic or general topics that they're talking about and if you act just out of left field it's going to be like wait what what are you talking about right so what's appropriate to the context？

😡，So the conversation of the person， right who's this person or people， what's their currency。

 as we discussed before， what is valuable to them？And then the environment。

And whenever you're not acting in a way that's， you could say appropriate to these three things。

 you will produce this thing called cringe。Yeah， we heard term cringe， like what makes us cringe。

 it's when someone does something that isn't appropriate to those three things。Okay。

 that's a lack of social calibration of social awareness right it's like when something's a little bit off。

 that's why if you have a cring conversation or something like oh， that was kind of a vibe killer。

 that's why。Okay， now。To be clear， though。Going a little bit more nuanced on this。

 this doesn't mean that you must always be this you could say kind of chameleon like oh what's the context and always adapting sometimes you can impose a new context right like if you join a conversation and say everyone's talking about say finance right like stalk and you come in and your frame as we also previously discussed is a lot stronger。

And say their frames are very weak， they're very reactive and you're like， by the way。

 you ever hear about letting go， you could actually impose that。Okay， so it's a bit more nuanced。

 but biggest thing to。In terms of social awareness is。

 whether or not you're going to impose that new frame， you better ask yourself what's the context。

 you better be aware of it at all times。Then of course， what's appropriate to the context？

And you can always stretch it a bit， but I was like once more within authenticity appropriate to the context。

 and then another key question is does it add to the vibe？Okay， does it add to the vibe。

 anything that takes away from the vibe， a vibe killer？Inherently low value lack of social awareness。

Okay， an example I've used for years too was say I'm doing a live event。

And I'm talking about a certain topic right or say here， say we're talking about this right now。

 social calibration say one of you is like，y raise my hand have a question。And say I'm like， okay。

 what's your question and say your question has nothing to do with this topic here。What would happen？

It wouldn' add to the value， it would kill our flow。

 and it would communicate massive lack of social awareness， Aka low value。it sounds like it。

 by the way， so I was out yesterday and you know I was a little scared to say hi to someone what do I do say someone asked that right now everyone would pinge inside like why。

Not appropriate to the context doesn't add to the volume。Right。

 the same with if someone say asks a question。And talks for 20 minutes。That there。

 although you could say the person has great intentions right。

 it could be a great question if they start or say they share something。

 they have something to share that would really add value to this。See I'm like， oh。

 share away and they start talking for 20， 30 minutes。It's going to actually be low value， why。

 because you weren't here to listen to them。Right it's the same as if I went to a comedy show I'm like can I come on stage and tell some jokes to everyone be like no。

 we didn't fucking come here to see you but my jokes are good doesn't matter we didn't come here to see you。

But it's authentic， doesn't matter， we're not here to see you， it's not appropriate to the context。

Okay and there's tellss right like this is not just black and white it's it's a feeling you develop right like you could start sharing a story and for the first minute it's actually valuable and everyone's locked in but as soon as you pass that minute mark you're going to start seeing people like cringe cringe cre is activated no because it's not appropriate。

Okay， so this here， these other foundations when it comes to authenticity relaability。

 When you're talking to someone or group of people， there's a certain vibe。

 a dynamic that's being built。 right now， we're building something together。

 There are things you can say that add to it。 There are things you can say that take away from it。

Make sure it's always adding。The same when you meet friends。

 the same when you go out to dinner with someone， you're building something together。

And you'll see when someone says something's a little bit， takes away from the vibe。

 It could even be interrupting someone at the wrong time or bring up some topic that people you already all talked about。

 It's like， oh， I thought we were done with that topic， takes away。Never take away from the vt。

And here it really comes down to being creative。The more creative you are。

 the more you'll be able to find that sweet spot and be authentic。Never compromise that authenticity。

 but do get creative in terms of how you express it so it does connect with people。

 and it's a win win。
