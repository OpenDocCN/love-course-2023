# 朱利安《高频沟通》：7 自主练习：7.4 拿掉社交过滤（口无遮拦）

This one's a little bit more chill。With this exercise here？

You're going to familiarize yourself with the filters and barriers and walls that we have internally。

If you're someone who's ever run out of things to say， you have certain filters。

None of you ever have nothing to say。 It's impossible。 You want to know why。

 because none of you are the Dalai Lama。None of you are in line。 None of you。Have that quiet mind。

 247。If you dig into that little voice in your head， it's yaapping about right now in this moment。

 It's by thinking， what do you mean， I'm not the Dalai Lama。There's something to say。

If you simply narrated what was going on in your mind。

 you'd be able to talk and talk and talk and talk and talk。

Probably even trying to go to sleep at night。 It's yapping about。

 you could talk and talk and talk as you try to fall asleep。The problem is that's going on inside。

 and then you have all these filters， is this good enough？You have this bar。

 and depending on who you talk to。If you place them on a pedestal outside your league， you're like。

 well， to impress that person， the bar' is really high。Am I the daillma。

 That's not good enough to say that You stuff it down， What about this， What about this。

 And with every piece of information is's either good enough and you say it or it's not。

 and you stuff it down。That's what most people do。That's also why if you talk to someone。

 you believe， oh， they're in the same league as me， or I'm outside their league， the bar is gone。

Or it's lowered。Now， your job here is to familiarize yourself with that and to get used to just。

Lweing or dissolving that bar completely。So for this exercise， it's going to be 30 seconds。Each。

 you're going to face each other。You're going to go one by one for 30 seconds。

And your job is to simply。Quie your mind and wait for something to pop in。Wait for a thought。

 Wait for an image。 Wait for a memory。A person， whatever。 Wait for just something。

 some piece of information to enter your mind。 And then instead of asking yourself。

 is this cool enough to say， is it okay， What does it say about me， What if I verbalize it。

 What are they to think about me Oh， does it ruin myself image， Oh am I still gonna to be cool。

 Just say it。😊，And then once you say it， you quiet your mind again and you wait for something else to pop it。

Now， a couple little things here， don't draw off the environment。You can't be like。Room， seminar。

 lights， right， You can't do that。And you can't。Pink from or draw from the previous word。

 If you quiet your mind in something it's like， water， ship， Titanic， No， you can't do that。

 Wait for something new。 Okay， so as an example。Literally just quiet it and wait don't force it either。

 just wait for something to pop up， frog。So popped up。Period blood。Window。Do with your eyes。

 close out first， then open your eyes， and then just own it。Grass。Pube。Don't know what I。

Maybe it was paying enough period blood。Toe。The letter B。Humidity。Blonde。IfThere's nothing。

 just wait。Jesus。Good one to end on。For real。 that actually popped up。没有。That there， like no joke。

 if you're able to do this and just practice like， just say it。

 just lower that time from thought to verbalizing it。You will not run out of things to say。

 The reason you run out is there's so much going on。 And you're like， that's not good enough。

 That's good enough。 They're not going to say。 And then you just loop on more and more and more。

 and it just builds up this resistance and gets worse and worse and worse。Just say it。

 And then guess what。 If you say something。 And it's like， Jesus， youre like， wait， what。

 roll with the punches。 Yeah， Jesus， you know， in the pen， like he invented the pen， right。

Whatever it is。So for 30 seconds here， this is a more chill1。 You're gonna to face each other。

 and you're going try this。 This can be a little hard to grasp， especially if someone is just mental。

 mental， mental， but see if you can。 just like， wait for something to enter your mind。😊。

So you have to stop thinking about the exercise， quiet it。And then see what kicks in next。

 It might even be like， what are we doing tomorrow， tomorrow。You've verbalized that。Face each other。

 If you want to do ice closed for the first 10，15， you can， then eyes open，3，2，1。Go。
