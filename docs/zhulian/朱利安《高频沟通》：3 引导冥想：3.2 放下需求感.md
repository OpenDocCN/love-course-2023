So let's start by tuning into that little voice going on in between your earsã€‚

That little voice going around in circlesã€‚Trying to find the answersã€‚Going around and roundã€‚

 analyzingã€‚Tune into itï¼Œ and I want you to slowly start visualizing itï¼Œ moving down your spineã€‚

Still going around in circlesï¼Œ but that's fineã€‚Getting more and more distantã€‚Getting quieterã€‚

And quieterã€‚Moving all the way down until finally reaching the base of your spineã€‚

And we're going to lock in that positionã€‚ You're now thinking from thereï¼Œ breathing from thereã€‚

 Your ears are down thereã€‚ Your nose is down thereã€‚

 You're out of your head and grounded at the base of your spineã€‚

And we're going to do three grounding breathing cycles from this positionã€‚

From the base of your spineï¼Œ tune into it and inhale for the count of six now oneã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚

 hold for threeã€‚Exhale for sixï¼Œ2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚Hold for three againã€‚And breathe normallyã€‚

Getting out of your headï¼Œ getting into your bodyã€‚Taking up more spaceã€‚Becoming more awareã€‚

And let's get ready for a second grounding breathing cycle from the base of your spineã€‚

 inhale now oneã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ï¼Œ old for threeã€‚Exhale for sixã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚Hlold for three againã€‚

And breathe normallyã€‚Getting more in touchã€‚Feeling more connectedã€‚

And let's get ready for a third grounding breathing cycle from the base of your spineã€‚

 Your ears are down thereã€‚ Your nose is down thereã€‚ Inhale now 1ï¼Œ2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ï¼Œ hold for threeã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Exhale for sixã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚ Hol for three againã€‚And breathe normallyã€‚You're out of your headã€‚

 grounded at the base of your spine connected to what's going on insideã€‚

And what I want you to do now is to shift your awarenessã€‚To the different sensations that come upã€‚

Around approvalã€‚The need for approvalã€‚The need for validationã€‚The need for recognitionã€‚

The need for acceptanceã€‚Welcome any and all sensations around thisã€‚Needing approvalã€‚Validationã€‚

 recognitionï¼Œ needing to be seenã€‚To being acknowledgedã€‚Welcome the sensationsã€‚

Is there any need or craving around thisã€‚I need people to like meã€‚I need people to acknowledge meã€‚

 to recognize just how good I amï¼Œ to recognize how cool I amã€‚I need people to approve of meã€‚

To see this about meï¼Œ to see me in this specific wayã€‚The need for approvalã€‚

Caring about what other people thinkã€‚Seeking the attention of another personã€‚

Welcoming in all sensationsã€‚And let's get ready for a first cycle here opening up to these sensationsã€‚

Letting them take overã€‚Allowing yourself to experience them fullyã€‚

Any and all sensations around the need for approvalï¼Œ the need for validationã€‚

 the need for acceptanceï¼Œ recognitionã€‚The need to be acknowledgedã€‚

Tune into those sensations now and inhale for the count of 6ï¼Œ1ï¼Œ2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚ Hol for threeã€‚Let it goã€‚2ã€‚

3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚Hold for three againã€‚And very normallyã€‚let's sink even deeper into thisã€‚How does this needã€‚

 this cravingï¼Œ this desperationï¼Œ how does this run youï¼ŸHow does this control youï¼Ÿ

Needing the perfect topicï¼Œ the perfect thing to say in order to impress someoneã€‚

I need to impress themã€‚ I need them to like meã€‚I need them to like what I'm sayingã€‚

 I must say the perfect thingã€‚ I must say the most interesting thing or they won't approve of meã€‚

The need to look a certain wayã€‚I need to look this wayã€‚ I need to look goodã€‚

 I need to look cool for approvalï¼Œ for validationã€‚Welcome to sensationsã€‚

I need to have a good response for everythingã€‚I need to say something wittyã€‚

 something clever all the timeï¼Œ I need those good reactionsã€‚How does this control youã€‚

 how does this run youï¼ŸAlways looking out for good reactionsã€‚

Perhaps selling out on your authenticityã€‚Saying things you don't meanã€‚

Doing things you wouldn't normally do for approvalï¼Œ for validationã€‚

Presenting yourself in a certain wayï¼Œ dressinging in a certain wayï¼Œ acting in a certain wayã€‚

For recognitionï¼Œ for acceptanceã€‚And the heaviness that comes with thisã€‚The paranoia feeling stifledã€‚

I can't act the wrong wayã€‚ I can't be the wrong thingã€‚ I can't say the wrong thingã€‚Or elseã€‚

I need to fit inã€‚ I need to be acceptedã€‚How does this run youï¼Ÿ

And let's get ready for a second cycle hereã€‚ Any and all sensations tune into them now and inhale for 6ã€‚

1ï¼Œ2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ï¼Œ hold for threeã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒLet it goã€‚2ï¼Œ threeï¼Œ fourï¼Œ fiveï¼Œ6ã€‚Hold for three againã€‚

And Ruth normallyã€‚And can you recall a recent situation where you really craved approvalï¼Ÿ

Were you really caredï¼ŸWhat someone thought of youã€‚Where you really needed them to think well of youã€‚

Can you recall a recent situation where this controlled you and ran youï¼ŸWelcome to sensationsã€‚

Can you recall another situationï¼ŸA situation where neediness just took overã€‚

A situation where you might have placed someone on a pedestalã€‚

Where their approval just meant the world to youã€‚Can you recall another situationï¼ŸCan you recallã€‚

Perhaps the first situationã€‚The first time you really started caringã€‚About what other people thinkã€‚

 the first time you really started needing that approvalã€‚

And just open up to any and all sensations that surfaceã€‚And let's get ready here for another cycleã€‚

 Any and all sensationsï¼Œ tune into them now and inhale for 6ï¼Œ1ã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚ hold for threeã€‚Let it goã€‚2ã€‚

3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚ Hol for three againã€‚And breathe normalã€‚æ˜¯ã€‚And what comes up when you hear me ask youï¼Ÿ

Do you feel complete right now in this momentã€‚Is there any resistanceï¼ŸTo feeling completeã€‚And if soã€‚

 just allow the sensations to surfaceã€‚Do you feel good enough in this momentã€‚Do you feel wholeï¼Ÿ

Or is there perhaps a part of youï¼ŸStill grasping outside of yourself for moreã€‚

I'll feel good enough when I get thisï¼Œ when I have thisï¼Œ when this person approvesã€‚

 when this person likes meã€‚Is there a part of you still reaching outside of yourself for completionï¼Ÿ

A part of you that might still believe that something is missing within youã€‚

How do you feel about yourselfï¼ŸWhat's the relationship like that you have with yourselfï¼Ÿ

Is there any resistance to being youã€‚Needing moreã€‚Is there still the need for moreã€‚

The need for betterã€‚Just welcome the sensationsã€‚The need for approvalã€‚That force reaching outsideã€‚

And could you perhaps take a moment nowã€‚To give yourself some approvalã€‚

What if what you're after is not out thereï¼ŸWhat if it was always in hereã€‚

Could you give yourself some approvalï¼ŸIs there any part of you that is still disapproving of yourselfï¼Ÿ

Withholding that approval from youã€‚And before we shift to doing our biggest breath yetã€‚

I want you to repeat the following statements out loud after me and justã€‚Notice the sensationsã€‚

 There's any resistanceã€‚That surfaces as you repeat these statementsã€‚Repeat after meã€‚

There is nothing missing in meã€‚I am good enoughï¼Œ as I amã€‚I am wholeï¼Œ as I amã€‚I am completeï¼Œ as I amã€‚

Nothing out there will ever enhance meã€‚Nothing out there will ever diminish meã€‚

I have everything I needã€‚And lastlyï¼Œ I am everything I needã€‚Just tune into the sensationsã€‚

There's any resistance that came up after repeating these statementsã€‚Any sensations leftï¼Ÿ

Tune into themã€‚ And let's get ready for our biggest breathã€‚ Yetã€‚ Any and all sensations inhale for 6ã€‚

LetYour shoulders relaxã€‚Detach your tongue from the roof of your mouthã€‚Like your jaw relaxã€‚

 like your neck relaxã€‚Let every muscle in your faceï¼Œ every muscle in your body just melt right nowã€‚å•Šã€‚

AndJust see how relaxed you can getã€‚See how light you can getã€‚Letting go completely nowã€‚

Releasing any an all tensionã€‚Letting every part of your body just meltã€‚

From the bottom of your feet to the top of your headã€‚Getting so lightã€‚

 you can almost feel yourself floating upã€‚Floing upã€‚Beyond the bodyã€‚Beyond the mindã€‚

Beyond everythingã€‚Floating up into this space of peaceã€‚Of perfectionã€‚The space of wholenessã€‚

Where all is goodï¼Œ all is wellã€‚Where you're exactly who you need to beï¼Œ where you need to beã€‚

The space of complete belongingã€‚Where everything is just as it's supposed to beã€‚

Just how it's meant to beã€‚Where you are everything you are supposed to beã€‚

And just take a moment to hang out in this spaceã€‚Of perfectionï¼Œ of belongingã€‚Of wholenessã€‚

 and just merge with this space right nowã€‚With every inhaleã€‚Fillling your body with loveã€‚With lightã€‚

 with warmthï¼Œ with strengthã€‚And just become one with his space right nowã€‚WithEvery inhaleã€‚

And having merged with his space completelyã€‚Having reconnected to this wholenessï¼Œ this perfectionã€‚

I want you to take this with you and to slowly start bringing your awareness back into your bodyã€‚
