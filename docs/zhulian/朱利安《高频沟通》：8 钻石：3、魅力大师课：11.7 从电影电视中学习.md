# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：3、魅力大师课：11.7 从电影电视中学习

So building on this， a big part of charisma for me was actually also extracting value from movies and TV shows okay。

 with every single movie that I've seen， every TV show that I've seen， of course。

 I'm enjoying the experience of watching it。But。The one thing I put above enjoying the experience of watching it is scanning for charisma value。

And you should too okay， as we talked about becoming this caricature of yourself。

 guess what one thing that will allow you to accelerate this process and get in touch with it is by seeing a lot of examples right the more examples you see of people becoming caricature versions of themselves hey。

The easier it'll be for you to do that to you as long as you don't try to copy to keep asking yourself。

 what is my version of that？Okay， and it's real people， of course， but guess what？

This also happens in acting right what is it that actors do they supercharge their personality or supercharges a certain character so that it really kind of screams out through the screen and captivates your attention and just because it isn't real per se or like well it's all you know fiction doesn't mean that there is no value。

With every single thing that I watch， there's always charisma value that I'm extracting Okay。

 the first one that I wrote here is in Summerholderer in the vampirere Acts Okay。

 this one here I then， although it's again a very kind of cheesy vampire love triangle show。

The acting and the acting from here in Summerholderer too is just so over the top exaggerated。

Though one， it really gets you in touch with different facial expressions and subcommunications and it just really makes it easy to see the caricature version of himself right so even if he's saying something it's like you'll see like the eyes and eyebrows are like just move in like crazy as someone's talking or he'll do as little stare and he'll do like as calculated blankqui。

😊，嗯。Yeah。😊，Right like it's just very over the top almost silly but is a good first place to start I got so much value from that so I would suggest looking at it right again you can put the storyline aside just look at the acting right or even go on YouTube for all of these and there's so much more that I could add to this list go on YouTube and look up some of the scenes。

Right look at what's the vibe here， what's what's my again， what's my version of that right。

 say you were in the role of the vampire A， how would you do it？Here's another great bonus exercise。

And this is an exercise I give in Transation mastertry Academy。Record your audition tape。

For all of these， imagine you had to record an audition tape but you had to send to the producers。

 send to the director to get hired for the role。You can make it a one minute tape。

 you can make it a five minute tape。How would you do it so say right now。

 boom youre you're sending something in a video to be cast for the vampire priorities。😡。

How would it be， how would you do it for that specific role， you'd probably do some research on it。

 you'd be like well， what's my version and you' lay in the middle of the road？Not that cut lost。

Meaphorically。ExentialallyDo you need help？Yes， I do。 Can you help me？You're drunk no， yeah。

 it's a little maybe。No， please don't leave I really do need know。I don't want any trouble。

 neither are do I。That's all I got。かも？Why can I move。🎼The man。🎼过去。はいちゃすか。🎼哎也没信。I have a big one。

 and he never said it out a loud。What's the point， it's not going to change anything。

 iss that going to make me good me adopt a puppy？I cant。🎼Be with other。And what she wants me to be。

This is who I am， Jessica。If you're going to hurt me I'm not sure。You。Do I kill you。とかなるけど。

But I have to Jessica。Because I'm not human and I miss it， I miss it more than anything in the world。

There's only so much hurt a man to take please。フか。Next1， Val Kilmer and the doors。Amazing。

 it's so amazing again， it's not super accurate per se it' a bit more on the exaggerated side。U。😊。

But if you take say Jim Morrison the doors， like Val Kilmer nails the performance to the point where some people even prefer Val Kilmer when they think of Jim Morrison。

 they think of Val Kilmer。Such an amazing performance。Everybody in。The ceremony is about to begin。

Ocup。Jim。explode， you can feel it in the air， planet you screaming for change， Morrison。

 we've got to make the myth。🎼Go on。 kill me。Actually Valal Kimilmer also in tombstone。

 another amazing performance must be。I asked the rum。You retired too。Not me， I'm in my prime。Yeah。

 you look。You must be Ringo。Looked， Alan。John E Ringgo。

The deadliest pistol Le else sinces wild building。What do you think， Dolin， should I hate him？

You don't even know him。As true。I don't know， there's just something about him。

Something around the house。I don't know。Reminds me of。妹。No。I'm sure of it， I hate him。

Look at that it's like what about those characters like if you these a lot of these two are characters we just really remember them through the years。

 they're very memorable it's like what about them。it made it stand out。

And then again record your audition tapes for that and see and then watch the tapes pick up on the subtleties right you do this you add this habit to your movie watching TV show watching whatever that is for you。

 you're going to see an immediate correlations your charisma shooting up a lot faster。Heath ledger。

 of course， in the dark night。You know？You remind me of my father。I haven't my father， Okay， stop。

Well， hello， beautiful。You must be Harvey's squeeze。And you are beautiful。Well， you look nervous。

Is it the scars？You wantt know how I got。咁样。系い。我干没。So I had a wife。又来风。Like you。Who tells me？

I worry too much。ho tells me I ought to smile more。Hell gamles and gets in deep the sharks。

One day they carve her face。We have no money for surgeries。🎼She can't take it。

I just want to see her smile again。I just want know it， I don't care about the scars。So。

I stick a razor in my mouth and do this。To myself。You know what。She can't stare on the sight of me。

🎼He5意。Now I see the funny side。Now I'm always smiling。嗯。Li fight now。

I like that Lords of dogtown as well， I remember there was a line in Lord's of dogtown's。About。

 you know， so long ago so I watched it was like。SSurferers and skateboarding。

 so it was about skateboarding。All right， how surf。

I hope i'm not getting the other way around it's not skateboard surf and surf became skateboarding anyway there there's one reason that this competition in these。

😊，And he's just telling someone like kind of in his own like。

World acting kind of long here iss like nice socks， man， nice socks。

 And there was no joke probably three to four months of my life where every interaction。

 I just blurred out nice socks， nice socks。 I'd be walking through。

Vue and just like okay I was like let me start talking to some people and I'd be walking through the venue and every couple feet I'd be like tap tap that socks man that socks that socks those socks are just complimenting everyone's socks So again just from a little show like that tones you can extract yeah hi。

😊，Yeah， this isn't a library， so it's 10 bucks to browse， you got 10 bucks。

Didn't bring any money today。Yeah， why' did you come into my store then asshole？Okay。

Well browseing the valley coop。说话 you该 cash what man I got something better than cash。

Johnny Depp and Pirates of the Caribbean。Just that body language alone and again i'm saying don't copy。

 but doing your audition tape or at times if you want to incorporate some of the behavior and just see how it feels。

Mess around with it right what I like about this so this is a key distinction you can incorporate and mimic temporarily。

To see how it feels and to see if there's perhaps some resistance around embodying that side of you。

 as long as you remember that the goal isn't to mimic and it's a temporary step to discover your own version of that。

Right with the Johnny Depp parts of the Caribbean， I remember。

I got into this really exclusive venue in LA just off。

The Johnny Depp mixed with Val Kilber in the doors charisma alone where I was in line and I was。

 you know， just wearing like a plain t shirt。And I was like， you know what。

 let me see if I can just get in。By acting like a half。Rock star。Half junkie。

Type of person just is an experiment again that's also my mind where it's like let's experiment。

 let's see right what's the worst happens you can't get answer so I'm like so how would this kind of hybrid of。

😊，Rock star Jim Morrison kind of crazy， mixed in with kind of like a bit of a drunk junkie style and like Johnny Depp。

Body language。 And I was literally just like， oh yeah。

' it's just me and my friend and just kind of like slow and like kind of just doing the weird stuff like just me and my friend and kind of like looking up to the side。

 leaning， like talking as I'm looking behind me just totally out of it and and I got in right so you can try it on it and test different size。

 But then find your own version。😊，What。Same with beer and loathing in Las Vegas， amazing performance。

 is it what Zicio Dl Toro is in that， also amazing performance？🎼，Okay。Why。We had two bags of grass。

75 pellets of mesculine， five sheets of high powered bladder acid。A salt shaker half full of cocaine。

The whole galaxy of multicolored uppers， downers， screamers， laughers。Also a quarter tequila。

Quter rum， Ca of beer， pin of raw ether， two dozen am。Not that we needed all that for the trip。

But once he get locked into a serious drug collection。The tendency is to push it as far as you can。

The only thing that really worried me was ether。There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and afraid。

in the depths of anther bin。And I knew wed get him that rotten stuff pretty soon Robert Panson and Twilight as well as the lighthouse。

Twilight I again is similar to vampire ir， it's like really over the top exaggerated and I heard too recently。

Don't ask me how I heard this or why I know this but apparently for that specific role when you went to the audition he was so nervous that he took a bunch of Val and I guess during the audition he just seemed a bit spaced out and it's the same kind of spaced out vibe and feel that went into that twilight movie just the first one the next ones sort。

Terrible， but the acting in the first one was really good， it means if you were smart。

And stay away from me。And the lighthouse as well， it's just him and willem defoee black and white such a crazy performance and again just look up the scenes on YouTube you'll see it right it's like wow like。

Just there's just something about that that stands out that speaks to you right it stands out in a relatable way here because it's a movie you got him five。

た。干 down。Smell like piss。Smelly jssm。Like rotten dick， like like curle forkin。

Like hot onion fuck farm yard shit house I'm sick of you small， I'm sick of it， I'm sick of it。

 you got damnamn drunk， you got damnamn no account， sort of a bit ba of lia， that's what you are。

godddamn， drunken horse shiting short。Shit liar。A liar DiCaprio in totallylips。

Are playing this kind of amazing French poet， right， humble？

When I was young and golden thought all I needed was experience and I can create new colors my new God and actually with Robert Panson there's another one called down Bell at me。

 you smell， it turns my stomach。Because you smell of him。You felt be husband。

I used to laugh every time I might have you to think I'd send you back to with my sweat on your skin when all the while。

 it was me。I was the one。And then the aviator， I really love that one， especially。

The scenes where he's kind of this is also with my personality。

I love the scenes that kind of lead towards this kind of crazy debauchery over the topness。

 So anything that again stretches the anticipated script， right， So when you see the aviator。

 people like， oh yeah， his actings good。 When I think of the aviator。

 I think of Leo diCaprio like sitting naked in the chair， just yelling， Come in with the milk。

 Come in with the milk， right，'s like that there's something crazy about that。 Come in with the milk。

 Come in with the milk， come in with the milk， come in with the milk， come in with the milk。

 Come in with the milk。 He used to open the bag with his right hand。😊。

And hold the bag out to me at a 45 degree angle so I may reach into the bag without。

Without touching the paper。Paidted from the beginning。Repeated from the beginning。

Repeat it from the beginning。If there is any variation of these instructions。

Even to the smallest degree。The entire process。Must be repeated。From the beginning。

 come in with the milk heated， come in with the mail at the beginning。Come in with the come the。Q。

And。🎼请。🎼E。🎼H。🎼T意。🎼A。🎼And。🎼你。🎼And。UmSame with like Daniel Day Lewis。

 and there will be blood like kind of the crazier scenes， who was nursing you， poor Eli。

 one of band his sounds。That land has been had， nothing you can do about is God had if you you take this lease Daniel train。

Three July you boy。Drain drop。I'm so sorry。If you have a milkshake。And I have milkshake。

And I have a straw。 There it is。 That's a straw。My sure。Reaches。Csしてる。

And starts to drink your milkchi。I drink your milkshake。

I drink it up Jeffardine Morgan and the walking dead right amazing performance too there's there's a period where I was watching that show and I think unconsciously like。

I kind of I kind of bined those seasons where he was in this was on tour and I think in some of my speeches for some reason the cadence and the way his character would talk came through the seminars and were even a couple comments like sounds like Negan in the walk and dead as like。

Good catch。 Was it purposeful that A came out。 I hope you got your shit and paint on。喂。You shit你妹。

I hope you're wearing，Ca you。A'm about to shit your pain。David De Cuffy California。

 are you an artist？Or pretender， neither。I'm a writer， I think I type I drink。

 leatherther rinse repeat， not always in that order， as far as I'm concerned。

 art's just another guy from Brooklyn I used to be a pretender。Donwn Johnson， Miami Vice。

 the way we used to be together。I don't mean lately。But before。It was real。Wass that。🎼Yeah， boss。

You bet it was。🎼啊。🎼Sny， what's wrong？🎼一章。🎼我。Mad men John Ham。

 you're born alone and you die alone and this world just drops a bunch of rules on top of you to make you forget those facts。

 but I never forget。I'm living like there's no tomorrow。Because there isn't one。

Cruel intentions I mean the list could go on and on but those are just some of the really more extreme examples that I personally resonate with right so you can check those out but then ask yourself like which ones do you resonate with and which ones are also aligned with your authentic personality and your authentic interests right these go hand in hand with mine even probably hearing some of those you're like oh yeah I could totally see how Julian resonates with that it's like very congruent to。

Me right to the caricature of me find some that really are congruent to keep the caricature of you and help you highlight and textize that character。
