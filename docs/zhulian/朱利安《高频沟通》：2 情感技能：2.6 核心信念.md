The second thing are core beliefsã€‚ core beliefs are original beliefs that form the foundation of your bearings on the worldã€‚

Okayï¼Œ so remember once moreã€‚You're bornã€‚What's this thing called lifeï¼Ÿ

 And you're going to want to quickly figure it outã€‚ This is hardï¼Œ Oã€‚Ohï¼Œ this makes soundã€‚ Oh thisã€‚

 Ohï¼Œ this right Oï¼Œ interestingã€‚ So you're going to start testing things out and you're going to form your bearingsã€‚

 What's this thing called lifeã€‚And there are two ways in which you're going to form these bearingsã€‚

 two ways in which you're going to learnã€‚Number one is through firsthand experienceã€‚Ohï¼Œ it's hardã€‚

 okayã€‚Ohï¼Œ if I do thisï¼Œ it makes a soundï¼Œ rightï¼Œ firsthand experienceã€‚

 And the second way is through secondhand experienceã€‚Where instead of say doing this yourselfã€‚

 someone else might sayï¼Œ heyï¼Œ Julianï¼Œ if you put your hands togetherï¼Œ it's going to make a soundã€‚

 Thank youã€‚Now in lifeï¼Œ do we have the luxury and time to learn everything and try everything firsthandã€‚

 Yes or noï¼Œ Noï¼Œ rightï¼Œ So the majority of what we're going to learn about this thing called life is going to be through secondhand experienceã€‚

Andã€‚This is very keyã€‚The way that we take on what we learn from others is we filter it through three thingsã€‚

Number one is certaintyã€‚So if say you were telling meï¼Œ heyï¼Œ Juliaï¼Œ if you put your hands togetherã€‚

 it'll make a soundã€‚ I might have never heard someone clap beforeï¼Œ I'm likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ reallyã€‚

 I'm going to filter it throughï¼Œ is this person certainï¼ŸIf they're likeï¼Œ heyï¼Œ if you do itã€‚

 it'll make a sound versus it'll make us soundã€‚So how certain is this personï¼Ÿ

How congruent is their behaviorï¼ŸRight when they're saying thisï¼Œ they are their thoughtsã€‚

 words and actions just very alignedã€‚ likeï¼Œ heyï¼Œ if you put your hands together pretty fastã€‚

 it will'll make a sound versusï¼Œ as we talked about beforeï¼Œ you could beï¼Œ you knowã€‚

 loud and you could have the confident traitsï¼Œ but something might be a little bit offã€‚

 People sense that Right It likeï¼Œ heyï¼Œ if you put your hands togetherï¼Œ It'll make a soundã€‚

 you're like a little bit offï¼Œ rightï¼Œ So congruencyã€‚And the third one is authorityã€‚

 how much authority does this person haveï¼ŸRightï¼Œ and the authority one is big because this means that during your childhoodã€‚

 when you're forming these original bearingsï¼Œ these original beliefsã€‚

The main sources of information that people have the most authority are going to be your parentsã€‚

Or whoever is raising youã€‚They have a lot of authorityã€‚

 You're going to believe what they say over what some kid in class will sayã€‚Number twoï¼Œ teachersã€‚

Number threeï¼Œ the classroomã€‚Rightï¼Œ and it it's not just necessarily one kidã€‚

 It's the entire classroomã€‚ That's like from your perceptionï¼Œ the entire worldï¼Œ rightã€‚

 instead of saying just him sayingï¼Œ if you do thisï¼Œ itll make a soundã€‚

 sayy everyone here is saying thatï¼Œ yepï¼Œ he's rightã€‚ He's rightã€‚ He's rightã€‚

There's a lot more authority behind that beliefã€‚okã€‚So the classroomï¼Œ children at schoolã€‚

 and then societyï¼Œ mainstreamï¼Œ mainstream mediaï¼Œ so on and so forthã€‚

Those sources have a lot of authority and anything that passes those three check marksã€‚

 we accept them is trueã€‚Even if they aren'tã€‚Soã€‚Rightã€‚

You might have different beliefs that hold you back when it comes to expressing yourself whereã€‚

Maybe as a childï¼Œ you were taughtï¼Œ heyã€‚You knowï¼Œ putting yourself out there is selfishï¼Œ it's rudeã€‚

 be quietï¼Œ and let others speakã€‚You knowï¼Œ don't make yourself the center of attentionã€‚

Or being the center of attention is very dangerousï¼Œ just blend inã€‚Sa you heard thatã€‚

A lot of certaintyï¼Œ a lot of congruencyï¼Œ say it was both your parentsã€‚A lot of authority here likeã€‚

 okayï¼Œ and you say you formed the belief putting myself out there badã€‚That's a core beliefã€‚

And a core belief once more is at the foundationï¼Œ meaning that once you form oneã€‚

You then build new beliefs on top of thatã€‚Okayï¼Œ putting myself out there is badã€‚If that's trueã€‚

 that's going to then filterã€‚The future bearingsï¼Œ rightï¼Œ It's like putting on a pair of sunglassesã€‚

 Then you see the world through thatã€‚ Wellï¼Œ if that's badï¼Œ then this is badã€‚

 And this means this because I'm this person in advertisingã€‚

 there's all these beliefs that then branch off of this original core beliefã€‚Rightã€‚

 it could also have the core belief through firsthand experienceã€‚ rightã€‚

 It doesn't just come from secondhandã€‚ It could be firsthand whereï¼Œ sayï¼Œ as we talked aboutã€‚

 there's a rumor that you like someone in the classroomã€‚You're likeï¼Œ wowï¼Œ that's terribleã€‚

 I'm going to never do thatã€‚ And you will formã€‚ You will not only suppress the aspect of you that shows interest in someoneã€‚

 but you also have that core belief that showing interest in someone is badã€‚

 And then you build new beliefs and new beliefs on thatã€‚ and you live your life this wayã€‚Okayã€‚

We all have theseã€‚ We have core beliefs when it comes to everything and anythingã€‚

And we will always try this happens unconsciously to stay congruent to these core beliefsã€‚

This also explains a lot of self sabotageã€‚We think cell sabotage is us screwing ourselves overã€‚

 That's not necessarily trueã€‚ A lot of cell sabotages were're trying to stay aligned with these beliefsã€‚

But we're not always aware of these beliefsã€‚And realityï¼Œ you always do and get what you wantã€‚

 you're just not aware of the part of you that wanted itã€‚

RightSo if you believe putting yourself out there is badã€‚You can try with as much effortï¼Œ likeã€‚

 let's do itã€‚ But you're always going to feel that pull that's pulling you back to not doing it to stay aligned with that core beliefã€‚

Because here's the other big fearã€‚Okayï¼Œ we have massive resistance to becoming aware of theseã€‚

 by the wayï¼Œ and even more to letting them go becauseï¼Œ heyï¼Œ what if this isã€‚Perhaps wrongã€‚

The whole belief tree crumblesã€‚So we'd rather double down on that on what we knowã€‚Oã€‚

 if you read the bookï¼Œ the seven habits of highly effective peopleï¼Œ Stephen Coveyï¼Œ amazingã€‚

 amazing bookï¼Œ highly recommend itã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒHe talks about this with the idea of paradigmiseã€‚

 and I've quoted this many timesã€‚ I love itã€‚ I'm paraphrasing hereã€‚ But what he says isã€‚

 imagine right nowï¼Œ you knowï¼Œ we're in Los Angelesã€‚And I were to give you a map of New Yorkã€‚

 I'm likeï¼Œ here's a map of New Yorkã€‚ Go find your way around L Aã€‚A is it going to workï¼Œ Yes or noã€‚

 Noï¼Œ what if he applies a lot of willpowerï¼Œ a lot of hustleã€‚

What what if he has a really good attitude and positive mindsetï¼Œ is he going to find his way aroundã€‚

Noï¼Œ rightï¼Œ what if he gets accountability partners that nothing's going to workï¼Œ rightã€‚

 It's the wrong mathã€‚Nowï¼Œ imagineã€‚ and this is what we doã€‚ By the wayï¼Œ everyone hereã€‚

 this is what's crazyã€‚ We have a map like thisã€‚ We have a map that isn't entirely accurateã€‚

 So step 1 is realizing that we have a mapã€‚ Step 2 isï¼Œ what if it's not entirely accurateã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Now imagine I were to give you this map of New York from the moment you were bornã€‚

 And no one told you it's the wrong mapã€‚ And you're looking aroundã€‚

 and everyone else also has a map of New Yorkã€‚ And you've been trying to make this map work your entire lifeã€‚

What if now I just appear I'm likeï¼Œ by the wayï¼Œ that's the wrong mapã€‚ Here's the L mapã€‚

A you can experience resistance to accepting thatï¼Œ because that means everything you've been doing is wrongã€‚

 It's such a hit to the ego that people would rather double downã€‚

 And what happens is they convince themselves that the answer of making that map work is just always outside of reachã€‚

That's a lot of peopleï¼Œ tooï¼Œ rightï¼Œ Social scammerã€‚ It's likeã€‚

 I don't want to assume that the map is wrongã€‚ It's just this next little tip and trickã€‚It's the mapã€‚

Okayï¼Œ so core beliefsã€‚Is the second big thing that keeps us down there that affects our beingã€‚
