# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：3、魅力大师课：11.2 内在魅力

So inner charisma really has to do with unleashing that raw authenticity that has to do with the vibe and it's something that you're born with this is important to understand okay 80% of charisma is something that you already have inside of you you had it from birth。

Right， it's when you're born and you'll see this too， for example。

You know I have a daughter when when I see the way she expresses herself， although she doesn't have。

 for example， a huge vocabulary and can't say polish the delivery of what she's saying like Jordan and Peterson it's still very charismatic simply due to just that raw authentic vibe right there's no stifling there's no the conditioning there's not the self-doubt there's not the oh' what I'm saying good enough it's just this very free expansive energy and you could literallyacy you know like what is say one and a half year old saying like a random word you're like that's very charismatic okay so this is something that you are born with you as a child you two were very charismatic right you were in touch with that authenticity there was no walls between you and putting that out there in the world however。

Then you got socially conditioned right then you experienced trauma then life really happens and you started hiding parts of who you are right。

 you started creating that split within you started perhaps fearing， putting yourself out there。

 fearing， being seen on all levels and you started slowly telling yourself this is me putting yourself in this little invisible prison and this is all the charisma that I'm allowed to have a very limited amount if that okay and then from that little prison what people do is they try to。

Seek charisma in the external。 they do it from this compensating place right it's like， oh。

 if I can just do this， if I learn this little tip。

 when in reality you have to understand and know that there's nothing missing for you to tap into that right now。

 Okay， in fact。Right now， there are some environments and around some specific people where you are extremely charismatic。

Okay， this is an important reference to take in and I wrote this down right and what environments can you naturally unleash this around who can you naturally unleash this if you think of someone who might be very stifled。

Just in the real world right you can take the typical let's just say kind of video game nerd video game geek right who's like might walking down the street can't hold eye contact can't talk to anyone you know it's like can I just do this and they get home you might think that person's not charismatic what are you talking about well perhaps perhaps in the external world they aren't but when they go home and they put on say their little headset and they're playing their video games suddenly extremely charismatic extremely chatty。

What's that environment for you？Perhaps you can't be charismatic when you talk to people you think。

 oh， or above your league， you put on a pedestal。People you think， oh， they have a lot of value。

 you start stifling yourself， but maybe with some close friends。

 you let some of that innate charisma shine， maybe around your family， right you can let that shine。

the same as some people are extremely funny， for example， around friends and suddenly it's like， oh。

 go tell that joke， go do an open mic or something and they like freeze up for that。😊。

So take in the reference that you already have that within you。There's 100% one environment。

 maybe even just you by yourself in your room just talking to you right or you scrolling through the internet or maybe you're on YouTube and you're talking yourself right it might not even be this subtle as good it might not even be out loud but that little voice in your head you talking to you can be very charismatic right you don't run out of things to say you're dis on point you might even make yourself chuckle or laugh you already have that。

😡，The key， however， as well。How can I unleash this all the time？

How can I unleash this in all environments， how can I unleash this？Around。

All people versus only in this specific situation， only with that specific person。

 how can I just make this the default？Okay， so taking the reference that you already have this。

 there's nothing missing， you're born with it。Do write down and really audit and reflect on right now in this moment around who and what environments and why reflect on this。

 why is it that in this environment I can， but that environment I can't what comes up？

Because it's different。For everyone， we're all conditioned differently。

 we all form different beliefs， we have different experiences that really shape us and affect us。

For one。Right they might not be charismatic and they might hold in because they think。

 oh well with that person， you know they expected me to be very serious and that might stifle them for another person right they might have a charismatic is they're like well I'm scared of putting myself out there I don't want to be too loud and I want people to see me so it's the fear of being seen so it's different things that run us do reflect on this a lot of key information key data to identify here okay another question to ask yourself here is was selfex something that was acceptable during your childhood。

during the way you were condition in your household。

 was it acceptable to be allowed to put yourself out there。

 was it acceptable to be the center of attention， was it acceptable to be a little artistic too。

Right and this even leads to the next question can you allow yourself to be seen what charisma it really is is it's you being very vulnerable right on the inner side similar to just singing right it's funny how everyone can talk and you're like well here's my voice talking but then people get really shy and stifled around singing when it's the exact same you it's the exact same voice you're just doing something a bit more。

Vulnerable with your voice， same with charisma， adding， for example。

 a certain range and really letting that true you shine。It's putting yourself out there， right。

 especially based in authenticity， it's taking that real you and putting it on the line。

And it can be scary I lot of people like I don't want to fully be seen and those are key questions to reflect on can you allow yourself to be seen and what are you hiding？

If you put yourself out there， what are you afraid people will see？What outcome。

 what do you think is going to happen？Okay， so this here is really the foundation of the inner side of charisma it's something you have there's nothing missing。

😊，To get in touch with this， it really has to do with letting go removing what's in the way and then also reflecting on what exactly might be。

 you know， putting those blocks between you andleashing that right， whether it's certain people。

 certain environments， conditioning， fear of being seen right。

 fear of being found out right like the real me isn't good enough， oh。

 I can only express my voice like this， but not like that。He information to dive into and let Go of。
