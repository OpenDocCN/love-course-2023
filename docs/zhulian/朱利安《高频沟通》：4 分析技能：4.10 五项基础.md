# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.10 五项基础

We tend to place a lot of value on the words being said。And as I mentioned。

 we as humans are preverbal beings。So yes， what you say must make sense it can be a complete gibberish。

 but it's not the most important and before you bring your awareness。

 like say you're talking to someone and it's just not clicking。

 you're not getting that sweet spot you're not there yet， before asking yourself。

 is it the content of what I'm saying？Bring your awareness to these five things first these are the five basic requirements if you aren't on top of these。

You're not even having a conversation， it's not even an interaction。Number one。

And these might sound very simple， but trust me。This here is the majority of sticking points that I've seen in thousands of clients when it comes to socializing。

Number one， can they hear me？You will be amazed at a lot of these interactions， like people like， oh。

 just didn't click， God， they didn't like me or they didn't want to network when they couldn't even hear that person。

Especially if you're someone who's gone used to speaking very quietly。

 right we talked about that stifleness。 What happens is once you speak quietly for a long period of time。

 the internals readjust and in your head， it sounds like you're speaking normal。

And when you try to speak normal， it sounds like you're screaming because you haven't you messed up the adjustments you could say。

 So a lot of people are like， hey， what's up， Hey， what's up， And no one hears them。

 And they're like， well， I guess it's what I'm saying。 It's like， no， they can't even hear you。

If they don't hear you， it's not an interaction， it's not a conversation， so number one。

 can they hear me？Number two， am I smiling？That， too， you'd be amazed just by adding a smile。

 how much that changes。Because if。You're nervous。 You're scared。 again， stifled。

 You're talking to someone。 The facial expression is just terrible。

 Like the two most common facial expressions of people trying to work on their social skills are either。

😰，So scared。 like some's off。 We're just like。😰，Or so scared and tensing up and trying to make themselves do it。

 It looks like they're about to take a dump。Like that。 And they're like， And it's just like， hey。

 and if they just smiled。😊，Game changer。So before is it what I'm saying， can they hear me check。

 am I smiling， oh no， let's fix that first？Number three， am I holding eye contact？

Now not over the top， remember it's a dance， it's on and off， pressure on pressure off。

 but if you're not looking at someone in the eyes， it's a lot harder to communicate a lot fast。

There's that famous saying the eyes are the windows and the soul。 That's true。

 You can tell so much from a person in terms of how they feel what they're thinking just by looking in their eyes。

So on your end too。Even in terms of calibrating， you better be looking in their eyes。

 Otherwise it'll be very hard to tell。If that's scary， you get used to it。

 action trigger release repeat。Okay。Number four， am I facing them？Think of it as。In a conversation。

 there's this flow。If you look away， you start restricting the flow。 If you face away。

 you start restricting the flow。If you want。It to go well。

 it doesn't mean at all times be facing them。 it's again， it's a dance， but at first。Open it。

 So the flow of authenticity， they can get a read for you。 They can get a feel for you， face them。

And number 5， am I within proximity。Realize that and be careful with this only be calibrated。

 but the more proximity， like the closer you are to someone， making sure that they're comfortable。

 the more they will experience you。Right， like， I could speak this volume this far away。 like， hey。

 man， how's it going。 Hope you're a good event。 same thing here。Hey， man， how's it going。

 I hope you're having a good event， same volume， same tonality， much more powerful。

 the closer you are。Okay， so these five things first， if they're all check。

 then you can ask yourself， okay， what about what I'm saying？Can they hear me， am I smiling。

 am I holding eye contact， am I facing them， am I within proximity。

 the basic requirements of any interaction？
