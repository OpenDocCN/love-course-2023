# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.11 4层沟通

And then when it comes to communication。Key dynamics to bring awareness here too。

 there are four layers。Number one， there's what you say。The words。

And this is what everyone obsesses about。Number two， there's how you say it。Number 3， right。

 how you say it is sub communicationations， tonality， so on and so forth。

Number three is your intention behind it。And number four is your level of self esteem。What you say。

 how you say it， your intention behind it， your level of self esteem。The deeper you go。

 the more powerful that layer or channel of communication。And what we do is we do the opposite。

 we think what's the most important is what you say。What you say is the least important。

The words and reality are simply the vehicle for someone to experience you。

 they don't get to know you through the words。They do to a certain extent。

 but they really get it through。What those words， like the vehicle。

 like what they contain in terms of the vibe in terms of the experience， right。

When I'm talking to someone， I'm aware of all four layers。Of course， we have to say make sense。

 has to make sense。 but it's the least important。 I'm much more aware with how I'm saying。

 what I'm saying。So for example， tonality。You could ask a question。

 we call this trying for a poor where your voice goes up at the end， like， hey。

 do you like the event， Oh， really， Oh， you did that yesterday。Right， it's like， hey。

 it's like the people pleaser。 You're trying like， hey， really， oh， oh， that's awesome。 Oh。

 I like that one， too。 Yeah， right。😊，That's going up。You could say the same thing。 Hey。

 do you like the event with breaking rapport。 Now， this doesn't mean like you versus breaking rap。

 just how you naturally talk。 Hey， so you like the event。 you like the event goes down。 Oh， really。

 that's awesome。😊，Oh， did you do that yesterday。same words。You could say it in many different ways。

This also isn't just tonality， but also facial expressions。 right。

 You're not just talking with the words。 You're talking with your entire being。Right。

 adding movement。A lot of people there is just like this the whole time。Hey， sorry yes or statue。

 It's like， no， keep it moving。 right， If， if you're stuck like this。

 it will restrict so much in terms of that second layer， how you say it。And one exercise here。

 I'd suggest everyone does is。Go home in front of the mirror。

And just look at your range of expressiveness。If you looked at yourself in the mirror， seen yourself。

Imagine you had to communicate to you that you're angry， but you can't talk。

What would that look like for most people， it's just like。Communicate you're happy。

Communicate you're sad。There's not much going on versus angry。Yeah。We're happy。Saad。

 it's like there's much more range。 Add that with what you're saying。

 So by doing that mirror exercise， you tap into that layer。 That's the second one。

 Much more powerful than the first。The third one， though， is much more powerful than the first two。

 and that's your intention。Your intention behind it， layer number three。That's where。

Framees take place and technically even frame battles take place。So say I were to ask you， okay。

What I say， hey， how are you enjoying the event， That's the content。How I say it。

 Sa I do breaking rapport。 Hey， how are you enjoying the event。3， what's my intention behind it。

One example could be， I'm offering value versus taking value。Those are also two frames。

In one frame you're offering， the other one you're taking。Here's a key distinction。

We think that asking questions is bad。 If you ask questions， that's taking value， right。

Only if you're focusing on layer number one， you can offer value asking questions。

Interestingly enough， whenever I meet someone new for the most part。

 I'm just asking question after question after question。But my intention is offering value。

Here's the difference。Hey， so how are you liking the event？And it's like I need it。

 it's like the intention is， give me the answer。Here's the other one。 hey， how you li in the event。

Offering。Hey， how's it going， Hey how's it going。Hey， do you know where the event is offering？Okay。

 that's the intention。This is also where you'll say， again， the frame， I am awesome。

 Everyone's awesome。 Hey， how you li the event。😊，That's the frame。Okay， your intention。

 much more powerful。And then your level of self- eeem that's dissolving that split， unacceptable。

 acceptableable you feeling like you're good enough that there just， again。

 that being flows through everything you say or do。 people get a feel for it。

 they'll just know where you stand there。 That's letting go。 But that is the most powerful。

 then start being aware of the intention。 And to get in touch with the intention layer。

I would do the same thing。 Go in front of the mirror or even just now， like， look at me right now。

And say you were to communicate to me without talking， without moving your face。

 like you're now officially a statue。You can't move your face。 You can't talk。 Communate to me that。

You're angry。You can't frown。 you't。 you're just neutralle。 Com， you're angry。It's weird， right。

 It's kind of like this like Jedi。 Like， I am angry。 Do you feel that， right， that there， that's。

The intention layer。 That's the frame。So when I'm talking to someone like， these are the words。

 This is how I'm saying it。 And a part of my mental bandwidth is these are not the drawers you're looking for like that。

 okay。So those are the four layers and then pressure on， pressure off applies to the first three。
