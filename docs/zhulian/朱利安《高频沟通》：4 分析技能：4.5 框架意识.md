# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.5 框架意识

The next thing is being aware of。Frames。Okay。A frame。I， ultimately。The window， if you will。

 right window frame。Through which people view and interpret reality。At a most basic level。

We're all experiencing this thing called life through the frame of our senses。Right。But。

In different situations， in different contexts。Everyone has different frames。

There tends to be a mainframe that everyone adapts to， and frames are always shifting。

 There is such a thing as frames colliding when you meet。

 say someone or talk to someone you don't know， frame battles。

 and it is a dynamic to really be aware of。Okay， when it really comes down to making sure that authentic。

 you connects with who you're talking to， making sure that it's win， win。 Okay， so understand that。

People are always pinging each other to see whose frame is the strongest。 So just like value。

 people are ping。And a strong frame is not by what you say， but by who is reacting more。

So whoever has the most value will tend to be the person who establishes the frame that other people react to and adapt to。

So we took that example， right， It's like， say someone's into drinking， so on and so forth。

 Their frame might be drinking and drugs is awesome。😊，And around other people， that frame might win。

 But then they talk to someone who has a stronger frame who， in their mind has more value than them。

 who thinks that's not cool。 and you'll see them shift。 They'll change their behavior， their beliefs。

 They'll put the drink down， so on and so forth to adapt to the main frame。

Fraames where at play all the time。And。Anything can be viewed through a multiple amount of frames。

 So here's another example that's key。 Say you take a movie you're really excited to see。

 Sa right now， think of one movie you're really excited to see。😊，This is how frames impact us。

 It's crazy。Say you're about to watch it and right before you get a text from a friend who's like。

 hey， I watched that movie， it sucks。The visuals are terrible。What's going happen。That's planted。

 That's going to basically dictate the frame， how you're going to see this movie。

 And the whole time you're watching this movie， you're gonna to be thinking， why does it suck。

 Why did my friend think it sucks， Oh， I do see the visuals there。 Ohh。

 that's what your RIS is focused on。 And it will completely。

 You could say change that experience of you watching the movie。

Say right before the movie on the flip side， a friend texts you ands like， hey。

 that movie is actually amazing。😊，Same movie， your experience changes completely。Two frames。

 two ways of interpreting something。And these are at play all the time。say。

 you're interviewing for a job and say you don't have much experience and you're a little young for that position。

One frame could be which the person hiring you could be like， A you're a little young。

 You have no experience。 I don't know about that。 could be viewed as something bad。

But it could also be viewed as something good。 Here's another frame。 Hey， you know what。

 That's actually good， because I don't have all the bad habits that people with more experience have。

 I have more energy。 I'm fresh。 I'm ready to go。 I'm committed。 Just， I'm a blank slate。

 teach me the right way， and I'll crush it。😊，2。Same situation， Two ways of viewing it。Okay。

This also applies to what we talked about before。Say as a child。

 you start believing your stupid core beliefs。That affects the general frame in terms of how you interpret references。

 how you view the world。You might even make connections to core beliefs that have nothing to do with them。

 Sa you're like， I am not good enough。Right， and something happens in life that doesn't go according to plan。

 And maybe it has nothing to do with you。 But you might interpret， oh。

 that happened because I'm not good enough。So this is also why when it comes to breaking down references。

 letting go has to happen first right now， every single one of us is interpreting this moment。

 this call through a different frame。Okay， that's just how the world works。And what happens。

 especially in an interaction， is when you have two people who are different。

Who have different frames， right different ways of interpreting and making sense of the world and they come together。

They're going to have to agree on， for the most part， a hybrid or a mutually beneficial frame。Okay。

 now。If you want a little side note here， if you think of today's climate。

 especially in the US with social media and extreme right and extreme left， if you watch。

 say on Netflix， the social dilemma，They explain this where with social media and echo chambers that are created on social media。

 you reach this point where if you take the extreme right in the extreme left。

 there is very little in terms of how they interpret and see reality that they can mutually agree upon and that's why you have crazy conflict and people get triggered and there's such hate and it's actually it's quite dangerous that it keeps you evolving in that way because they're living at that point in two separate realities where there are no common there's no common grip。

Right so it's literally like you'll reach this point where it's like。

The other person will be viewed as like an alien， not even human because there's no more commonality。

All of us here， we are all every single one of you， all of us are unique。

 they're all going to be things that we disagree upon maybe not in the context of say sale help。

 but we're not going to agree upon the same kind of music or movie or whatnot we're all different。

 but for the most part there's some kind of common ground that we can connect to and relate to each other upon。

And then interaction， same thing come together， two people， two frames。Therere going to be。

 of course， some compromises with relatability authenticity， which we'll cover。

 but you're going to find a common ground。However， it's not this perfect 50，50 mishmash。

For the most part， the person whose frame is the strongest will tend to have the majority of that shared frame in the middle。

Okay， and for this reason， the way we work as humans is we're always ping each other。

 we're always ping the other person to see okay， who has the strongest brain and you'll more often than not do this unconsciously throwing different curveballs or things at each other and just seeing okay testing each other's brain like who here has the strongest brain who here is going to search。

The foundation of our shared frame。Okay。Now， strong frame。Is not necessarily by what you say。

 but by who is reacting more。Goes back to the magnet system where it's like。

 if you want to know whose frame is winning， whose frame is imposing like whose frame is leading。

 that'd be the best way to put it， it'd be the person who's reacting the least。

The person is reacting more。Meaning。Who cares more。

 whose behavior is shifting more to please the other person。If the other person talks。

 they'll be quiet faster， they'll value the other person more， if it ends。

 they'll care more about the interaction ending than the other person so on and so forth。

 that's the person with the weakest frame。And the person who the strongest frame。

 has the most social influence。Okay， and you can even take a group setting where it's like say there's everyone will be rated you know in the group at some level right。

 but the person with the strongest frame， when they say something。

 everyone in that group will have a stronger emotional reaction in response than if someone else with lesser value or a lesser frame says that thing a strong frame is also self fulfillfiling。

Meaning。This could be good or bad。 If you believe you're not good enough。

 and that's a very strong frame， You will always find your way back to that。

 You will actually manifest。That， okay， I had a client。 This is years ago in Amsterdam。

Wanted to work on putting himself out there， talking to people。And he would go up and say， hi。

 and people would love this guy。 They'd be smiling。 was would have， you know。

 they'd have a great time talking。 It was like， oh， your friend， so great， etc cetera， et ceter。😊。

At the end， though。He's like， oh， I sucked everyone hated me。That frame hijacked it。

 distorted reality to the point where we couldn't even see people smiling。

We want to stay congruent to that map。 It will also affect your behavior， too。

 That was a bit of a fluke one where was actually able to do well for a lot of people because they believe they're not good enough。

They actually start acting in ways to manifest that， and create。That reality。

 where people do believe they're not good enough。 And then with the reference they get。

 they use it to reinforce C。 It's because I'm not good enough。

And they bury themselves further down that rabbit hole。A strong frame， though。 this is important。

We tend to think that a strong frame is you imposing onto others。But in reality。

 a strong frame is dominance over yourself。Not others。It's knowing who you are， what you want。

 what you value。It's not about what you do to others。 It's just not getting sucked into all that。

 say， hey， this is me。People try to post frames， oh， you're this， you're this。

If you have no sense of who you are。If you haven't done a lot of work。

 you're going to be sucked into all of that。Versus， no， this is me。

And guess what the strongest frame is。Authenticity。If you're being yourself。

 if you're being congruent， thoughts towardss actions align， nothing throws you off。

You're putting on a front， Yeah， then you're gonna get sucked into frame battles。

 and it will be hard to maintain。But which is who you are， doesn't matter。Right。

 it's as if say word to tell you。 It's like， you know what， your blue hair sucks。 You're like， I。

 I don't have blue hair。It doesn't matter how much I dis the blue hair。

 Nothing will actually affect you because， you know， that's not you。

Get it the strongest frame isn't you trying to control others or impose it on others it's really dominance over yourself。

a strong frame is like my reality， my rules， based on authenticity， you know who you are。

 what you're about， what you stand for， what you value。

 and you know that so much and there's such certainty and confidence in it that you just own it and people react to。

Okay， strong frame in terms of you and people adapt and react to you versus you having this oh how do I take over others。

 take over yourself and have them chase and then yes。

 there is such a thing as frame battles and reraming things like you can reframe situations。

 talk about things through different light， but don't get sucked into becoming this frame control junkie。
