# 朱利安《高频沟通》：1 介绍：1.2 社交技能组成_ev

What are social skills， We hear this social skills。 It's very vague。 We're like， well。

 I guess it's the ability to， you know， network and talk to people or meet new people or if I move somewhere。

 how do I make friends or how do I communicate better with my friends， my loved ones， my family。

 so on and so forth。 It's a very vague thing。 And we tend to come at it with a very。

 you could say analytical mind。 Why， because a lot of us who have， you could say issues socially。

 just do the way the word're condition， we tend to， for the most part， be quite analytical。

 Qui logical， or basically nerds， right So we approach it in this very nerdlike manner。

 There's even a lot of promotion out there。 It says， hey， you know， social skills is a science。

 right， It's a science。 It's you recognize patterns and themes And you just use your nerd brain。

 and you figure it out。😊，And that's not entirely true。 It's more of an art form。 Okay。

 this is how I break it down。 If you take social skills。As。You know， the umbrella here within it。

80% here。Is。Emotional skills。20%。Is analytical skills。

That there is really what social skills consists of。 Okay， emotional skills。 that's the art form。

Remember this。Us humans， okay， the beginning， the origin of socializing happened before。

We learned how to speak before we learned words。 It's preverbal。

 It's this innate thing that we just all recognize。 If you think of music。

 it's like the soul of a song。 That's the foundation。 That's really what it comes down to。

That's 80% of it。 and then 20% is that science part where yes。

 there is such a thing as pattern recognition， right if you talk to enough people。

 you're going to start seeing similarities， commonalities， okay。

 that is also a big part of it right you go out and you talk to more people than you naturally should。

If I audit my life here， again， having worked on my social skills for since 2006。

 I've talked to more people than the average person would talk to in their entire lives。

 If you audit the average person just based upon situations that are presented to them， they talk to。

 say X amount of people。 you want to get good socially， talk to more people than that。Now。

 you have to know what to look for， you have to know how to break it down。

 you have to know what to work on， but there is such a thing as gathering a lot of references。

 seeing patterns， seeing commonalities， oh， this person， you know。

 their same personality is that type of person， Oh， same personality type。

 I know from references that if I say this at this time。

 it won't click as well as if I say it later on， you're gonna see all that。But that's just 20%。

The majority is emotional skills and the big problem。

 a huge sticking point people make when starting out。If you're someone who's again。

 a bit more logical， right， you like thinking， analyzing， that's me， by the way。

 is you try to tackle the emotional skills。Using the analytical approach。And that keeps people stuck。

 It keeps them stuck where they make a little bit of progress。

 but not quite the results they really want。 and they eventually fall back。

So there are different approaches。For both。Okay， the soul， for example， of a song， right。

 It doesn't matter how if you use your science brain， how technical you are It say playing the song。

 If there's no soul， that song is gonna suck。Right， but then。

It is good to have some technicality to it versus just kind of winging it。 It's like， oh。

 there's a lot of soul grades， but it could be better with a little bit of technicality。

 That social skills，80% is the soul。😊，It's what you would call， for example。

 someone who's just naturally social， right， There are people like that where they don't have any difficulty talking to people。

 They're able to express themselves and you're like， whoa， they're just a natural。 That's the 80%。

For that person， they then need to tackle the 20%。 They need to use their more nerd analytical mind。

 if you will， but。This here is really the foundation， and in terms of the results you'll get。

 you will have much more results if you focus on this first and prioritize this。

 that'll get you 80% of the way， and then with the analytical skills that'll get you that final 20% of the way。
