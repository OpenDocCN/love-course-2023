# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.2 什么是价值

Value。Is ultimately what causes quote unquote， attraction in any setting， it could be romantic。

 it could be friendship， it could be in a business setting， any setting， value equals attraction。

 value speaks to your RAS， your re activating system。Right now。

Where are you all focused on what I'm saying。In this moment， in this environment。

 the words I'm saying， this content， this presentation is the most valuable thing to you。

That's why you're focused on me and not， you know the person next to you or the ceiling or whatnot。

 it's like you're just locked in on me。Now that's general， and we're going to be breaking this down。

 but there's also more specific value where there are going to be times during this presentation where I'll say something that you will really lock in on more than other things and you might lock in on something and when I say that you might not as much and then I'll say another thing where you lock in more but not you so it does fluctuate but that's what causes attraction。

 It's like value it's where your attention goes it speaks to the RIS。And ultimately。

 if you want to break it down， value is anything that increases your chances of survival。

Reproduction。Or anything that makes you feel good， good emotions。

But that one can be tricky because you can feel good emotions for things that actually hurt your chances of survival and reproduction and you backwards rationalize that it's good for you。

Okay， now， this applies to， again， this will benefit me， but it also applies to threats。

If suddenly is a joke， some lion came in， you're not going to be listening to what I'm saying。

RightSo this is always on。 We're always scanning for value in any environment。

Here's another good exercise， if you close your eyes right now， do it。Close your eyes。

And keeping your eyes closed， if I ask you right now， what are five things in this room that are red。

Now open your eyes。Where are you looking for thread， like， what's right， What's right， What's。

 What's， speakaks to your focus。Okay。A good way to track。 And this is once more。

 something just start being aware of。It might temporarily put you in your head。

 and this is why letting go is so key， so you're able to be aware of this while remaining present。

But start being aware in any situation， where's the value。To do this。

 you can just follow the magnet effect。Think of values like a magnet， where's the attention。

 where's the attention？When does it shift？Even in a group interaction， you'll see it shift。

Start being aware of that。That's one of those。Beneath the surface dynamics。

 the people who are very good socially are always aware of。 Now， it doesn't。

Put you in this like now competitive state。 like， let's fight for the more value。 No， no， no。

 All of this here， the analytical skills once more is simply so you get a feel for the general situation that allows you to express yourself in a way that makes it win。

 win。 That's it。 When it comes to value。 There is such a thing as general value。

 but also situational value。So what does this mean？

General value could be oh you know if someone has let's me say a lot of money that will probably increase my chances of survival and my chances of reproduction so so money could be this thing that if you have someone has no money someone has money you might find yourself more attracted to the person who has money。

Okay， that's kind of general， the same with good emotions， that's a very general one。

 every single human， no matter where they live， what their background is， their upbringing is。

 they'll find themselves attracted to good emotions。However。

 there's also situational and that's where you zoom in on the context of whatever interaction you're having。

 right and in that context。And even deeper than that。

 the context of the person or people you're interacting with。What is valuable to them？Right。

 so for example， let's just say I talked to someone who is super into business and finance。

 knows nothing about spirituality or meditation and just is this very logical numbers driven person。

Okay， say that's the person， that's the context of the person。Based upon that， if I start saying。

 hey， you know， there's a thing called letting go and I start breaking it all down。

 although that is say valuable， extremely valuable。Would that person find it valuable， yes or no？

The answer of course is no， right， because that's not their quote unquote currency。Okay。

 and this is a question I ask myself all the time， what's this person's currency right and what currency do they operate in oh for this person it's more on the logical money business side that's what they find valuable。

If I start going into the spiritual route， they're not going to relate the same as if I talk to someone who say very spiritual and say we take one of those extremes where they're spiritual and they give up their possessions and they're all about。

 you know， et cea non materialriistic and I'm like， hey， you know。

 that's great but you know it's even better as being spiritual and using that as a foundation to thrive in life and I start going into marketing and money and sales etctera。

 et ce。That's not going to resonate with them as much。

It's the same as if you take someone's favorite movie and you know that if you talk about that movie or anything in that genre。

 they'll light up versus another genre they。Okay so what's someone's currency what speaks to them what do they find valuable and this will of course depend on the person。

 their personality type okay and this is also something to start familiarizing yourself with what's their personality type right logical emotional extroverted introverted right more you could say intuitional you can study different personality types right you can go through the Myers Spriggs personality type I think Jordan Peterson has really good one as well there's also disc DISC okay disc and you'll see people go through like for Quaed so personality。

can be very beneficial to go through that and just familiarize yourself with you don't have to know it like the back of your hand。

 I don't。But just so you get a general feel for like， where would I fit this person。

 what would speak to them？Okay， so you got to find okay， what's their currency， what drives them。

 what do they find valuable right the same as if you talk to someone who'sum let's just say a computer programmer from small town versus someone who wants to be an actor in LA。

Very different sets of values。喂。They're going to resonate with different things。

 be interested in different things， so that depends on the person。Thenner's also within the context。

And then there's general value don't necessarily assume that people will see how what you're saying or who you are is valuable right where let's just say there is something that。

You would assume a normal person would see as valuable and help their survival reproduction skills right like oh survival great this person would really benefit my life。

You might know that， but don't assume that they know that you might have to explain to them in a calibrated way or hint at it or or kind of point like drop the bread plumumb so they kind of see it so they see oh how this is actually valuable right like even if we take the example of letting go。

😡，Um right now， a lot of like you all see oh letting go is extremely valuable。

 but not everyone gets that， so even though say I know that or you know that if you talk to someone。

 they might not know， oh letting go can actually drastically improve my life。

So you all have to sometimes explain it as a way of making it relatable。
