# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：4、高级社交技能-泰勒：12.4 晕轮效应

There's a distinction clearly between your base level value versus the way in which that value is framed。

 Okay， the base level value versus the way that that value is framed。 So， for example。

 if you were to go to say an art gallery， that same art that would be selling for， you know。

$5000 off the wall，$10000，$20000，$00000 million。Hundred million dollars。

 A lot of that is coming from what， where， Where is the price point of that art coming from。

 Is it just the art itself that makes it that valuable or what is it， perception the framing。

 the perception。The artist， which is branding， right the social proof is a really big one。

 the way that it's framed in the store， And so this also translate into when you have a relationship because whatll happen a lot of time。

 And this is something that I think we all fall into is we get in relationship and then say that you're with somebody。

 let's're gonna to have kids together or let's say that you're just in a deep committed relationship as an example or it could even be an open relationship but let's just say you have a lot of time you spend together。

 winds up happening is you say to yourself， I want to focus on making more money。

 I want to focus on adding to our relationship。 So maybe that same time that you would have spent going out or doing parties or having swag now of a sudden。

 what happens is that you reallocate that time and you're optimizing more for time spent together quality time。

 know for a lot of people， one of their passions of staying in shape and then they stop going to the gym another one could be you let to go out and hang out your friends and new parties but you stop doing that because you want to put time with that person But winds up happening is they're no longer wanting anything from you。

 You are。Just too available， So it's that longing or that like you're always just a little bit out of reach or it's that thing where you look like a superhero right。

 So you want to get it to where you come across like a superhero。

 You're always a little bit out of reach， there's always a little bit more to get。

 There's always another mystery to uncover。 you know， they don't have it all figured out。 And if you。

 if you just completely drop that right， And by the way， they all tell you to drop that。

 They all tell you they don't want you to do that。 And it's just a test。 It's like。

 don't do any of that。 You're like， okay， and then then you listen， they're like you listen， peace。

 they're out of there。 Okay， because the problem is it is。

 it is human psychology to always want the next thing。 look here's an example。

 It's kind of a sad example。 If you're walking through you know， a park right now。

 like a beautiful park， There's trees and water fountains and birds and squirrels。

What is the more valuable that or say， you know，100000 Rolex watch or Lamborghini。

You're probably gonna be a lot more fixated on a Rolex watch or Lamborghini like say that we're walking through the park。

 And then I said， hey， do you want this watch， Do you want this watch， Hey。

 do you want the keys to Lao， you want the keys to Labo。

 You're gonna be a lot more folks in the key to Lao or the watch and you on the park。

 But what's actually worth more。 literally， there's more value in a dead leaf than there is in a Lamborghini。

 There's more value in a carrot than there is in a Rox watch。 It's just that。

 if you actually think about it。 A Rolex watch is just a metal thing that human being put together that has branding on it。

 a leaf that has real life in it， Like there's like know all the little ass of X leaf in the fibers。

 like real actual life。 I mean， how many places in the whole galaxy is there actual life。😊。

As opposed to just elements just floating around， right。 So， yes。

 a human being puts the construction into Lamborghini and is perceived more in the marketplace。

 But that's my point。 The objective value of a half dead leaf is higher than a Lamborghini。

 But because why why don't we you view know， a leaf as being a value。supplyupply and demand。

 it's everywhere。 It's available。 What's that。 utility Yeah。

 but I could actually even show you there really is because you could connect to that in like the most incredible way。

 But the thing is you don't know how to do it。 And so the thing is is thats yeah we can't think of a utility because even in Rox watch less utility than time X for $30 from Walmart。

 But that at least has indilo on it。 But so the point being is that there's value that like we place value on these things that we don't quite have because as human beings。

 we live in a state of perpetuity of longing。 we always are longing for the next thing if you're in this beautiful nature。

 like right now， if I tell you're all gonna go to Hawaii， you're gonna think how great it is。

 But then once we get there， you're still gonna be thinking about other things。 Most of us right now。

 if we go to Hawaii like like perfect paradise， we don't have this psychological evolution to just be like。

 I'm in paradise it's like okay， when I'm in paradise， What's the next thing。

 It's almost like your lens in front of your face is always aligned where it can。😊。

See like what's in front of you。 It can only see like what's out there。

 And so so you're always kind of in the state of like， And so the problem is。

 is that if you meet somebody and you're right here available you wind up becoming that leaf。

 you wind up becoming Hawaii。 you wind up becoming that thing that's just so readily available。

 Like if you look at things like even truffles。 Like， I'm not even kidding。

 I just ate a chocolate downstairs from a bag that's worth over 10 dollars。

 And that's because it has truffles in it。 And it's funny because the girl who you saw here you know。

 some simp guy gave that to her。 Okay， and that's real。 and you'll send these sir all the time。

 So so what happened was， you know， he gave her these truffle chocolates。

 And I'm sure she's quite appreciative。 And so the point is that she gave me this。

 And and I just ate two pieces of chocolate that were probably worth like $100 each。😊。
