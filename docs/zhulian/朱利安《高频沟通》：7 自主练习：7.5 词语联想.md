# 朱利安《高频沟通》：7 自主练习：7.5 词语联想

Here's another one。 This is a great improv exercise。So word association exercise， where？

It's going to be two， again， groups of two。The person in front of you is going to give you a word。

That's all that they're going to do。 They're just going to give you the first word。

Now this one's a little complex。Based upon that word。

 what you're going to do is you're going to create a sentence around it。Okay， so， for example。

 give me a word。Apple。Apples are fruits， and some are green。There's a sentence， okay？Now。

 based upon that sentence that then I created， he only gives me the first word。

 what I to do is I'm going to pick another word within that sentence。

Apples are fruits and some are green。You can't pick the last word， so I can't pick green。

I have to pick a word within that sentence， so I could be fruits。 right， I like fruits。

 raspberries are my favorite fruit。😊，Rsber start with the letter R。

Letters are something that you send to people。Send is a word that is existed for a long period of time。

 existed da da， da， da da。Get it。 So he only gives me the first word， I craft a sentence。Okay。

 just to dry it out too。So word one， you get the word。You craft a sentence。

You cannot pick the last word。 It has to be somewhere within here。 From that。

 you craft another sentence。 You can't pick the last word。And then another one。 and then another one。

 And it keeps on going。Now with this。You can't make your sentences too short。You can't be like。

 you know， Apple。Apples are cool。Then there's nothing to pick from。

 but you also can't make them too long or then you lose track of the exercise。

Does everyone get the structure here？Now， this will be a little hard at first because you're going to be like。

 okay， I had to come up with a sentence out of the blue。 And from that。

 I've got to remember what I say and pick another word and come up with another sentence。

 remember what I say and pick up that， It'll be a little mentally challenging。

Once you get the hang of it。See how fast you can go。30 seconds or so each。Face each other。

 you get the first word from your partner， then you flow。Three， two， one， go。
