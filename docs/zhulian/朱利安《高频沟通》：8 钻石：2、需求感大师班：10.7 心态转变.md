# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：2、需求感大师班：10.7 心态转变

To get to the cause it really comes down to as we discussed dissolving that split within it's a lot of inner work However。

 as always， you can couple that with different mindset shifts for in the moment to complement the inner work that you're doing Okay。

 these here alone will not get to the cause。But they can definitely help and accelerate the process。

So the first one is realizing that the needing strategy doesn't work。Okay。

 and you have to really be honest with yourself here and take it in right。

 the more you need something。It doesn't make you take more action。

 it doesn't make you get the outcome more all that it really does is create a lot of self sabotage with it。

Okay， a lot of self sabotage and ultimately in terms of your experience of self a lot of lack that's all that it does okay the needing strategy to have a burning desire to succeed strategy does not work okay and you can also reflect on all the different times you thought it would work but it didn't right I mentioned what does neediness do it just always convinces you it just out of grasp out of grasp out of grasp when as soon as you get it's like the next thing the next thing。

We talked about the phones。Right notice how every single year or two right it's like oh the new phone and then you get it and I remember this was a bit more popular back in the day they might still do it but back in the day when you'd buy the phone they'd actually like if you went in person to buy it。

😊，They'd give you the box and they wouldn't open it they're like you open it sir it's like would you like to open the box and he' was like then you get your phone in the first few days you're like super careful about it you kind of feel this high like this new phone a week passes you're already throwing it and letting it drop on the floor you don't care。

And then you're on to the next thing， what are all those things you thought would complete you。

 all those things you thought would get rid of the neediness。The same with socializing。

 I remember when I first started I was like， hey， you know what。

 all I need is a good reaction from a stranger。Then I got the good reaction and you' we'll kind of experience like these temporary dirty highs you're like good reaction and then you fall back and then it's always more more it's like well got the good reaction now what I want a good reaction to last longer okay good I want more good reactions I want this some of it is just keep amplifying right I got the first iPhone I need the next one and the next one and the next one it's like take in all of the failed times that you just like just tried to。

😊，Complete yourself and it did not work okay， what makes you think that the next thing that's just out of grasp right now is going to be any different。

For you to actually believe that， right， you track your life experience like all the millions。

 billions of times it didn't work。And you think the next time it's going to work？Don't be delusional。

 don't be stupid the strategy does not work okay， what will satisfy neediness？It's only one thing。

And it's called more。Right that's the only thing they'll satisfy neediness if any of you the funny sign note follow liver King on Instagram right this hilarious like bodybuiler guy who's obsessed with just living like his ancestors there's one story like a real story that he posted a story it's a real now it's a real where he's。

He's like lifting weights and all he same between every single rep， he's like more。

 more like he's just over the top。🎼More。🎼More。🎼不。There's another one where he's like eating eggs out of this fish like his someone's like I think is his wife like squeezing out the eggs you's just like more las like anytime I hear if you want a funny graphic if you want to humanize the more。

 just think Li King okay， what will satisfy neediness bar Li King's face more okay。

 it's a bottomless pit， you can't satisfy it。Huge。Either you don't get what you want and then you need it and keep needing it even more or you get what you want and what does it do right it's like I just want the one little crumb I'm hungry I want the crumb you eat the crumb。

 you get hungry。It just amplifies， okay， it's a bottomless pit， nothing out there will ever。

 ever satisfy it okay， going deeper here too as we discussed neediness implies lack。😊。

You only need something that you don't have。Okay， neediness， needing equals lacking。

You'll never have it's like you don't have it's like net lack lack I need it okay and what happens is that the more you need something and this is also why this strategy doesn't work。

The more you lack it and the more lacking becomes your comfort zone。

 and this creates so much self sabotage。Okay， so let me break this down and do realize that understanding this。

 any time you've seen someone perhaps succeed when they really needed it because you'll see that there are examples of it right including myself in my earlier years。

I was just run by neediness and it would cause a ton of self sabotage。

 but I simply got really good at fighting this self sabotage so people who succeed despite really needing something。

They they were lucky like they needinginess didn't help them it actually hurt them but they were able to still succeed with the hurt that neediness did on them right with the disadvantage of neediness they were able to still succeed however what you notice is that any kind of success from that tends to be very temporary right so subtged will get you sooner or later and any kind of success from that isn't very enjoyable or fulfilling and that's also key right if you're not enjoying the results you're getting those are not results okay so what does it mean lacking becomes your comfort zone。

Well。Guess what， say you're used to really needing and feeling that void with it。

The more you experience that， the more you will become hooked on it， the more it becomes you。

Right I remember to illustrate this right you might have heard me talk about this before growing up I would。

This is like high school years， like early high school years， I was like， oh， if I just。

 I just really want a girlfriend and I would like you know go to bed listening to like Eo music and Eo songs and think about like once I have a girlfriend。

 my life will be complete。There was really that lack and there were actually a lot of opportunities for me to say hi to。

 you know people I I was interested in， but I didn't why because part of me didn't want to succeed right if I'm so hooked on needing a girlfriend thinking about how my life will be so much better when I have a girlfriend。

Listening to music， fantasizing about being in a relationship， having a girlfriend。

And say I do that night after night after night after night after day after day after month after writes like for a long time。

 I'm hooked on that that's part of who I am。And will I want a girlfriend， of course not。

 because what happens if I were to get a girlfriend？Suddenly I couldn't go back to that comfort zone。

I could no longer need a girlfriend if I had a girlfriend， what would happen to my imites？

So self sabotage pushes that away。Okay， whatever it is that you really lack and you need。

 it's like you're just going to get hooked on needing it and lacking it and it will create so much self sabotage so people who are going to really need something they have to now fight all that self sabotage to get the thing versus not having the self sabotage to begin with。

Okay。And then this here too， with reflecting all the times that it didn't work， right。

 a key quote here， the road to enlightenment is paved with disillusionment。

Meaning the more you realize it didn't work， it didn't work， it didn't work at some point。

 you're just going to stop being so stubborn and let go of that needing strategy。Okay， we also。

 this is key， live a world of duality。there's up， there's down， there's left， there's right。

 there's day， there's night， there's hot， there's cold。

everything has an opposite and the way the world works is there tends to be a certain pendulum that swings between the two。

You can go really deep on this in a book， for example。

 called the Kabalion right it talks about the pendulum swing duality， just the nature of the world。😊。

And if you try to。Again， find yourself in the physical。

And that's what neediness does right again taking that part of yourself is like you try to。

 you're ultimately and back to the manipulative， you're trying to use people， use things。

 use the physical to complete yourself。I'm trying to as soon as I get that， I'll be complete。

 so you're trying to use to complete。And you're trying to find yourself in the physical。

But anytime you attach yourself to something out there。

You're just attaching yourself to eventual failure， why？Because that world of duality。

Say you know it's like I I attach myself to I need， for example。

 even within you you might be really needy around looking a certain way right I need to look this way I need to be perceived this way I can't wear this or else I need to wear these clothes I need to it like that right I need to look good。

Well say you're attached to that what happens on the day where you don't look up to par with what you expect what happens is you grow older and suddenly it's like I need to look young right you lose it you're old you're young you're born you die duality。

He'll be he'll be taken for a ride the same is like good reaction okay。

 get a good reaction oh bad reaction you're just you're at the mercy of this swing。

So as soon as that's like keep saying as soon as you get something with fear immediately you'll fear losing it so you'll never actually get that satisfaction you're after right if I get a partner I'll be complete you get a partner。

Now it's like I'm going to lose the partner， I don't want to lose the partner and what does that do。

 it amplifies your neediness towards the partner。I want to be money and I'll be i'll be i'll be good okay you make the money now you're going to fear losing the money and it'll get you doubling down on the money even more again bottomless pit so attaching yourself to duality bound for failure。

Another one here too is。Just realize how fickle approval actually is。Right。

 this is something as a zealist celebrity， you'll kind of see the behind the scenes where over the years。

I've seen， especially at first in say comments like on social media or if I put a video out。

Or just in terms of people who follow me for a long period of time。

I've seen so many people go from loving me to hating me to loving me to hating me。

 it's just so fickle and same as people who hated me who then go to loving me。

Approval really doesn't mean that。we think it's like this ultimate thing it's like nah it's not right and oftentimes this is what's crazy the people who love you the most this more in a more zealous celebrity format like people who are quote unquote like super fans like I love it love it。

😊，Those are always the ones who turn into haters always。

 and then they turn back into the fans and back into haters。

 people who tend to be a bit more in the middle less。

 but it's always someone who's like overly like yeahy。

 I'm like you're going to be a hater one day and 90% of the time I'm right。

And once you're a hater you'll come back and then you'll keep riding this swing so do reflect on that right it's like how fickle it is how even someone might approve of you and then the next little thing they disapprove it's like why try to find yourself in that right and then also ask yourself who are who are the people you're really chasing approval from right like are you just going back to all these like these you know it's like just like。

Like strangers who're just giving your power straight it's like stranger approve of me right like even me with a comments is like anyone in the comments please approve of me right it's like。

Are those people like， would you respect their opinion of you？Yes or no， and if the answer is no。

 what are you doing， and even beyond that， this is to the last point here。

Nobody can approve or disapprove of you。If you actually think about it。

 why because only you know you？This is a big one right if you're run by that and you need it。

 realize that you'll never ultimately trust if someone approves of you or not。

And like I keep saying the approval you're really after is you because only you as have the final say because you have all the facts right what people think of you is a lot of it's just projection and speculation。

Like none of you， for example， know me。None of you do you you know parts of me from the glimpses that you might have learned from。

 say from videos or courses or。Again， if you've joined， say the mentoring like well。

 dialogues and stuff and you'll have， some of you will have more wholesome like real glimpses of who I am than others。

But even with all the glimpses that you've had。And someone would ask you， okay， describe like。

 you know， fill out a page on who is this Julian character。

 like describe him and who he is and his personality and what he values and how he is best you can。

You don't fail。Because some you would do better than others yes because you'd have more facts。

 but even in the end you're just kind of trying to make sense of those little glimpses right so you're kind of speculating and then a lot of it too is the internal colors the external you're also projecting a lot。

And the same with anyone， right， even if I were ask say。My family members， if I would ask like。

 my wife， it's like you just describe me， no one knows me as well as I know me。Same with you。

 no one knows you， your friends don't know you as well as you know you。

 your family doesn't know you as well as you know you only you know you as well as you only you have been with you back to that relationship with yourself right through this thing called life through the crazy experiences through the ups and downs。

 only you。Only you know what that felt like， what was like to be you during those times。

Only you know your darkest secrets and thoughts。So you're the only one who can ultimately make the final call。

 you have all the facts。To approve of you， yes or no。That's what it comes down to。And realizing that。

 hey， no one else out there can approve or disapprove。Freedom， it's extremely free。

You stop trying to find yourself out there。Okay， so these here are some more on the external side mindset shifts that really help okay。

 take this into the strategy doesn't work， stop investing in it， stop feeding it。

 stop buying into it。
