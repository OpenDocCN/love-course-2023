So let's start by tuning in that little voice going on in between your earsã€‚

That little voice going around in circlesã€‚That little voice trying to find the answersã€‚

 trying to find the solutionsã€‚That little voice over thinkingã€‚Making things hardã€‚

Coming up with excusesã€‚Taking things way too seriously tune into itã€‚

 and I want you to slowly start visualizing that voice moving down your spineã€‚

Still going around in circlesï¼Œ but that's fineã€‚Moving further and further downã€‚

 getting more and more distanceï¼Œ moving all the way down until finally reaching the base of your spineã€‚

And we're going to walk in that positionã€‚You're now thinking from thereï¼Œ breathing from thereã€‚

 your ears are down thereï¼Œ your nose is down thereã€‚

 you're out of your head and grounded at the base of your spineã€‚

And we're going to do three grounding breathing cycles from this positionï¼Œ your nose is down thereã€‚

 tune into it and inhale for the count of sixï¼Œ now oneã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ã€‚5ï¼Œ6ã€‚ hold for threeã€‚Exhale for sixã€‚2ï¼Œ3ã€‚

4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚Hold for three againã€‚And w normallyã€‚Getting out of your headï¼Œ Getting into your bodyã€‚

Becoming more awareã€‚And let's get ready for a second cycle from the base of your spineã€‚

 inhale now oneã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚ hold for threeã€‚Exhale for 6ã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚Hold for three againã€‚

And Ruth normallyã€‚Taking up more space insideã€‚Getting more in touch with that inner worldã€‚

And let's get ready for a third grounding breathing cycle for the count of6 inhaleã€‚ nowï¼Œ oneã€‚2ã€‚

 threeï¼Œ fourï¼Œ fiveï¼Œ sixï¼Œ hold for threeã€‚Exhale for 6ï¼Œ2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚ Hol for three againã€‚And weallyã€‚

You're now out of your headï¼Œ grounded at the base of your spine connected to what's going on insideã€‚

And what I want you to do now is to shift your awarenessã€‚To the different sensations that surfaceã€‚

Around saying hi to someoneã€‚Welcome the sensationsã€‚Seen someone you want to say hi toã€‚

You want to walk upï¼Œ introduce yourselfï¼Œ start a conversationã€‚

What sensations surface around this situationï¼ŸSaying hi to someoneã€‚Putting yourself out thereã€‚

Introducing yourselfï¼Œ starting a conversationï¼Œ what comes upï¼ŸAnd just welcome any and all sensationsã€‚

And is there perhapsï¼ŸAny resistance around thisï¼ŸAny fear around thisï¼ŸWhat if they think I'm weirdï¼Ÿ

What if I go up and I say the wrong thingã€‚I say something stupidï¼Œ what if they think I'm stupidï¼Ÿ

What if they think I'm try hardï¼ŸWhat if they think I'm creepyï¼Ÿ

What if they think I'm needy and low valueï¼ŸWhat if they mock meï¼ŸWhat if you think I'm a loserã€‚

 what if I'm awkwardï¼ŸWhat sensations surfaceï¼ŸWhat if they don't like meï¼Ÿ

What if I go up and they just ignore meï¼Œ They ignore whatever I sayã€‚

 They ignore me introducing myselfã€‚ How embarrassing would that beã€‚What if they shame meï¼Ÿ

What sensations come upï¼ŸAny fear or any resistance around putting yourself out thereã€‚

 introducingcing yourself to someoneï¼Œ saying hi to someone starting a conversationã€‚

 What if their friends will judge meï¼Œ What are other people going to thinkã€‚ðŸ˜°ã€‚

Other people are staringã€‚They're totally going to seeã€‚What if someone I know sees meï¼Ÿ

What if I make a fool of myselfï¼ŸWhat if I get rejectedï¼ŸWhat if I get into a confrontationã€‚

 what if someone comes up and says something to meï¼Œ what if they get mad at meï¼ŸAny fearã€‚

 any resistanceï¼ŸWelcome the sensationsã€‚And what comes up when you hear me ask youã€‚

 can't you let go of thisã€‚Can you let go of this right here right nowï¼Ÿ

Can you free yourself from this resistance and this fearã€‚

And we're going to shift here to doing another cycleï¼Œ but this timeã€‚On the inhaleã€‚

 letting these sensations take overã€‚And on the exhaleï¼Œ letting it all goã€‚Any sensations of fearã€‚

 Any sensations of resistanceï¼Œ tune into them and inhale nowï¼Œ1ï¼Œ2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ï¼Œ hold for3ã€‚Let it goã€‚2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ã€‚

5ï¼Œ6ã€‚ hold for three againã€‚And breathe normallyã€‚And let's go even deeper hereã€‚

What are some of the defeating beliefsï¼ŸAnd associated sensations that surfaceã€‚

People aren't open to being talked to anywayã€‚ What's the pointã€‚They don't want to be botheredã€‚

I don't want to imposeï¼Œ who am I to imposeï¼Œ Why would they want to talk to me anywayï¼Ÿ

What value do I have to offer anywayï¼ŸThey're probably talking about much more important things alreadyã€‚

Thinking about much more important thingsã€‚I don't have enough value to offerã€‚

They probably won't even give me a chance anywayã€‚I'll probably say something dumbã€‚

I have nothing good to sayã€‚Even if I doï¼Œ they'll probably lose interestã€‚ After a little whileã€‚

 they'll see through itã€‚They're outside of my leagueã€‚I'm not good looking enoughã€‚

Don't have enough moneyï¼Œ don't have cool friendsã€‚Why would they even want to associate with meï¼Ÿ

My life isn't where I want it to be right nowï¼Œ anywayã€‚I'm simply not good enough for themã€‚

Any sensations around thisã€‚Tune into themã€‚And what comes up when you hear me ask youã€‚

 can you let go of this right hereï¼Œ right nowï¼ŸAnd let's get ready for another cycle hereã€‚

 tune into it and inhale nowï¼Œ oneï¼Œ twoï¼Œ threeï¼Œ fourï¼Œ fiveï¼Œ sixï¼Œ hold for threeã€‚Let it go2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚

 Hol for three againã€‚And breathe normallyã€‚And what are some of the excuses that come upï¼Ÿ

Seeing someone you want to say hi toã€‚I don't want to do it right nowã€‚I don't have timeã€‚

I'll do it laterï¼Œ I'll have time laterï¼Œ I'll do it tomorrowï¼Œ I'll do it next weekï¼Œ not right nowã€‚

I'll just say hi to the next personã€‚I'm just not in the moodã€‚

I should probably do more releasing firstã€‚I'm not in a good enough state to say hi right nowã€‚

What comes up hearing thisï¼ŸI don't know what to sayï¼Œ I'm just a little too tiredã€‚

It's just not the right placeï¼Œ the right timeï¼Œ it's justï¼Œ it's too much pressure I justï¼Œ I I can'tã€‚

 I just can'tã€‚There's too many people around just not the right environmentã€‚

There'll probably be a better environment a better chance laterã€‚Either in a hurryã€‚

I'll just waste my timeï¼Œ I'll just waste energyã€‚Why wasted on something I know just probably won't workã€‚

How they're talking to someone elseï¼Œ it's not idealã€‚I don't want to bother themã€‚

 I don't want to ruin their vibeã€‚I just need more experienceã€‚ I just need more timeã€‚ You knowã€‚

 I justï¼Œ I don't want to be try hard and just make a mess of thingsã€‚ So I'll do it laterã€‚

 I don't want toã€‚ I can'tã€‚Any excusesï¼ŸWelcome the sensationsã€‚

And let's get ready for a third cycle hereã€‚ Tu into them and inhale nowï¼Œ1ï¼Œ2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ï¼Œ hold for3ã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Letticos2ï¼Œ3ï¼Œ4ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ6ã€‚Hold for three againã€‚And breathï¼Œ normallyã€‚And what I want you to do nowã€‚

Before we do our biggest breathing cycle yet is to repeat the following statements out loud after me and just welcome any and all sensations that surfaceã€‚

If there's any resistance that surfacesã€‚Tune into those sensations as you repeat these statementsã€‚

Repeat after meã€‚I have valueã€‚I am good enoughã€‚It's okay to put myself out thereã€‚

It's okay to talk to peopleã€‚Other people are on my sideã€‚The world is on my sideã€‚

I have nothing to fearã€‚I am awesomeã€‚Other people are awesomeã€‚The world is awesomeã€‚And lastlyã€‚

Getting so lightï¼Œ you can almost feel yourself floating up higher and higherã€‚And even moreã€‚

And even moreã€‚Floating up beyond the bodyã€‚ beyond the mindã€‚Floating up into this space that comesã€‚

Before everythingã€‚This space of peaceã€‚The space of perfection of abundanceã€‚

This space where all is goodï¼Œ all is wellã€‚Where you're exactly where you need to beã€‚

 who you need to beã€‚Where things are working for youã€‚Where the world is on your sideã€‚

 People are on your sideã€‚ Everything is on your sideã€‚And this stateã€‚Of loveã€‚

Connected to loveï¼Œ connected to abundanceã€‚Take a few more breathsã€‚And having merged with his spaceã€‚

I want you to take this with you and to slowly start bringing your awareness back into your bodyã€‚

All the way back to the base of your spine where we first startedã€‚Feeling your nose down thereã€‚

 your ears down thereã€‚ And let's do one final grounding breathing cycle from this positionã€‚

Your entire bodyã€‚And having merged with his spaceã€‚Feeling your body glowingï¼Œ feeling strengthenedã€‚
