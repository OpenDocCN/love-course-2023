Start a podcastã€‚Even if you don't put it out publiclyï¼Œ do it for funã€‚

 you'll learn so much about yourselfï¼Œ especially if you're someone who wants to improve your social skillsã€‚

Start a podcasts and take it seriouslyï¼Œ rightï¼Œ so have a nice setupã€‚Get a cameraã€‚

 If you don't have a cameraï¼Œ use your phoneã€‚ Make sure it's videoï¼Œ not just audioã€‚

And sit down and just once a week for one hourï¼Œ record an episodeã€‚

 It could be about whatever you wantã€‚But say you take that stepã€‚

You'll record your episode and then you'll review it you'll be likeï¼Œ okayï¼Œ wellï¼Œ how was itã€‚

 how did I doï¼ŸNow it's going to happenã€‚I you're going to probably start looking up other podcasts and you're not going to see them the way you had previously seen themã€‚

 It's not going to be this fun entertaining thingã€‚ you're going to be filtering it through your experience doing your own and you're going to pick up on subtleties you had previously not even picked up on say you're looking at your own and you're likeã€‚

 ohï¼Œ it's a little rusty there Oh my God a little too seriousã€‚ How can I inject some humorã€‚Nowã€‚

 you're going to be looking at another one and be likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ that's how they deal with thatã€‚ Ohã€‚

 look at that transitionã€‚ That's how they transitionã€‚ That was funã€‚ Ohï¼Œ they injected humor thereã€‚

 Ohï¼Œ how did they do thatï¼Œ Ohï¼Œ how did they shiftï¼Œ Interestingã€‚

 You're going pick up on all these subtletiesã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒBut to pick up on themï¼Œ for your focusã€‚

 your RISS to activateï¼Œ you need to take one step in actionã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒYou need to start doing it yourselfã€‚

 You'll see so much about your charismaï¼Œ your deliveryã€‚ It will also start training your focusã€‚

 your R S on a day to day basis to start looking forï¼Œ Oï¼Œ what I'm going to talk about next weekã€‚

 What happened to meï¼Œ What's interesting this weekã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWhat are some interesting things I heardã€‚

 I've seenï¼Œ I've witnessedï¼Œ I've doneï¼Œ I've experiencedï¼Œ what are some funny thingsã€‚

 things and conversations with friendsï¼Œ coworkers are likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ that's a good oneã€‚

 let me make we can note for the podcastã€‚ Your goal is every single week how are you going to fill an hour of content that is captivating the entire way throughï¼Ÿ

And don't let yourself off the hookã€‚ Don't make it boringã€‚ Ask yourselfã€‚

 would you watch this if it was on YouTubeï¼Œ if you stumbled on that videoã€‚

 would you be locked in or at what point would you fall offã€‚And you can audit thatï¼Œ you're likeã€‚

 what's my humorï¼ŸHow are you going to inject that into the podcastã€‚

 How are you going to learn to push your own buttons and make yourself laughï¼Ÿ

And not just when it naturally comes about in your dayï¼Œ that's easyï¼Œ rightï¼Œ Ohã€‚

 something naturally funny happensã€‚ You're going to laughã€‚ How can you do that on commandã€‚

And not fake itï¼Œ but like genuine laughterã€‚Because people try to logically thinkï¼Œ wellã€‚

 if I maybe say thisï¼Œ that might make me me laughã€‚ Noï¼Œ you should learn how to summon thatã€‚

 If you want another little side exercise to do thisã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒTry thisã€‚Whether it's on the podcastã€‚

 if you likeï¼Œ or even in an interactionï¼Œ say you're even talking to a friend guaranteed this little exerciseã€‚

 If you overdo itï¼Œ it won't workã€‚ But first time you do itï¼Œ will guaranteed some in genuine laughterã€‚

 It'll even do it nowã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒHere's the exerciseã€‚For one minuteã€‚At any point in that interactionã€‚

After every single thing that you sayã€‚You're going to do a very awkward little giggleã€‚

So he imagines likeï¼Œ heyï¼Œ nice to meet youã€‚ I'm Julianã€‚

 like that and just own it as if it's totally normalã€‚ It's likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ coolã€‚

 See you from Austin like the entire timeã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒNow noticeï¼Œ that actually summons genuine laughterã€‚Rightã€‚

 so that's one wayã€‚ But you need to learn how to do that for you at any timeã€‚

 and especially in situations whereã€‚There is nothing to really draw from in the environmentã€‚

 And it's a situation where there is even a little bit of pressureã€‚ We call this healthy pressureã€‚

 If you sit down and you do a podcastï¼Œ trust meã€‚It's going to be really awkward at firstã€‚

 You're going to you knowï¼Œ pull up your chairã€‚ You're going to be alone in your roomï¼Œ and your placeã€‚

Have your little phone camera set upï¼Œ sit downã€‚And it's going to be silentã€‚And you're likeï¼Œ wellã€‚

 here we goã€‚Welcome to the welcome to the podcastã€‚And you're going to have to learn how to just talk and talkã€‚

 There won't be any social feedback eitherã€‚And that's reallyï¼Œ really interestingã€‚

 I remember even Egar Toï¼Œ this is way back in the day when I first started learning how to you know create videos and I had so much trouble with thisã€‚

 by the wayï¼Œ for me to do a podcast back and day impossibleï¼Œ for me to even record a video blogã€‚

Took monthsã€‚ I almost actually didn't get hiredï¼Œ slash fired because I was so terrible at recording videosã€‚

 terribleã€‚If I was interacting and there was feedbackï¼Œ yesï¼Œ if it was a seminar like thisï¼Œ yesã€‚

 put a cameraã€‚I need the feedbackã€‚There's no feedbackã€‚ And Ehartoli actually talked about this tooã€‚

 He he's likeï¼Œ you got actually look through the camera and visualize like the people you're talking to versus this inanimate objectã€‚

 But you'll seeï¼Œ it'll be awkward at firstã€‚ and it will be very challengingã€‚

 but you will grow tremendously from thatã€‚ If you can summon genuine laughter in that awkwardã€‚

 quiet environmentã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWith the cameraï¼Œ knowing that people are going to see itã€‚

 even if you never posted itï¼Œ Imagine you didã€‚Going out and just socializing becomes a jokeã€‚

 it really doesã€‚It teaches you so muchï¼Œ tooï¼Œ about yourselfï¼Œ state controlï¼Œ state managementã€‚Againã€‚

 staying authenticï¼Œ but not letting the external just get you all reactive or get you to clamp up that podcast exerciseã€‚

 genius once you're able to do one a weekï¼Œ one hour of really solid contentã€‚Do two a weekã€‚

 do three a weekã€‚ Do four a weekã€‚That dareï¼Œ againï¼Œ it's a bit on the extremeã€‚

 but if you're someone who really wants to cultivate and you could say Polish your personality and improve your social skillsã€‚

What's an hour a dayï¼ŸWill you ever run out of things to say if you are able to do thatã€‚Noã€‚

You never willã€‚And it always has to be freshï¼Œ you'll see when you deliver a story that isn't fresh or a story that you've repeated a little too muchã€‚

 a story or a joke that you're trying to make perfect instead of just letting it flow out of you and that tooã€‚

That's the dance of socializingï¼Œ rightã€‚ It's having a certain intentionã€‚But at the same timeã€‚

 letting go of that outcomeï¼Œ right So it's like intention to do wellï¼Œ intention to succeedã€‚

 intention to say something interestingã€‚ Same with the seminar hereã€‚ by the wayã€‚

 I have a few notes that I'm looking atã€‚ I have an intentionã€‚ There's something I want to talk aboutã€‚

 But in the momentï¼Œ if I'm like too perfectionistsã€‚ Like it has to be exactly like the notesã€‚

 it'll stifle the soul of this speechã€‚There has to be room for some improvã€‚

Room for some joking around room where you're just likeï¼Œ let's just let go a little bitã€‚

Let's see what happensã€‚Same with your podcastã€‚ You're going to have to trustã€‚

 I'm going to trust that something's just going to naturally come out and it's going to crushã€‚

And then you're going to start seeing it in othersã€‚

Here's another thing you'll start noticing on a deeper layerã€‚

 You're going to look at other podcasts and you're going to see when they're in a flow state when they aren'tã€‚

 They're going to see when they struggle just like youã€‚Most people don't see thatã€‚

 They just see the surface layerã€‚ This is funnyã€‚ This is entertainingã€‚ I'm learning deeper layerã€‚

 It's likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ that's interestingã€‚ Here's one where they're in stateã€‚

 Here's one where they're out of stateã€‚ Here's one where you saw a dip in stateã€‚

 and then you can see them get back in state later onã€‚ What happenedã€‚ What shiftedã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

You should also even see the during live events hereã€‚Rightï¼Œ I like to thinkã€‚I'm a prettyã€‚

Say on top of my stateï¼Œ pretty genius type of guyï¼Œ state wiseã€‚ But I also have little dipsï¼Œ rightã€‚

 Not all my eventsã€‚Do I come upï¼Œ And I'm likeï¼Œ here we go like super energeticã€‚

 Like sometimes like a little bit more chillã€‚ You're going to see waves even in this speech hereã€‚

 rightï¼Œ The flow that we're in now versus the beginning is a little differentã€‚And thatï¼Œ tooã€‚

 funny enoughï¼Œ is what makes you captivatingã€‚ If it's like thisã€‚

 even though this might be captivating the entire timeï¼Œ you'll get a little bit boredã€‚
