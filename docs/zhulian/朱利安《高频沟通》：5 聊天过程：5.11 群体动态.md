# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.11 群体动态

You never remember， say hi to the entire group at once。Ever， ever， ever。

 you' always say hi to who the person you want to talk to straight up to that person。

Hello and then more often than not immediately after with like the split second after then you say hi to everyone in the group。

 but it's never hi group， it's hi to this person， hey， nice to meet you。

 nice to you and nice to meet you and nice to meet you。Okay， always the person you want to talk to。

 however。You will have to acknowledge the group。Huge because。And also get a feel for the situation。

 but I always assume at first that everyone in that group knows each other and even if they just met because they've been talking to each other for longer than you have。

 there is more investment with the group than you。Okay， so if the group doesn't like you。

And they might a bit， they'll care a bit more about the group's opinion and it just。

 it's easier to always go in， with the intention of befriending and winning over the group。

Sometimes if you find out after they really don't know each other and you're more captivating。

 you can just ignore the group and just focus on that person or the people who you want to talk to。

 but always go in assuming that they know each other and win them over。Okay。

 and once you say hi to them， that means saying hi to them， don't ignore them， okay。

 if they don't like you and're like oh， let's go， you're done。

But also hook them so hook everyone in the group and that also means quickly establishing what's the dynamic of the group right。

 how do they know each other， what is the currency of all the people here。

And there is such a thing as a more macro， you could say a group sweet spot。

 so there's different sweet spots with the people you talk to one on one。

 but then as's a general group that also contributes to the overarching sweet spot of what is relatable right where you could say something that to one person they might find it relatable。

 say it's a joke one person I find it really funny。

 but if you understand and you talk to and quickly assess the personalities of the people in that group。

You'll know， oh， maybe this one won't find it as funny。

Right or maybe this one doesn't see the value in me yet。

 so there just isn't as large of a sweet spot and you can also see this when you say hi to everyone in that group right so you say hi the person。

You really want to connect with。And then from there say it's like， oh， hey， nice to meet you。

 nice to meet you and say you just put your hand out like this， I love。😊，Shaakeking hands。

 I do this all the time， by the way， I always shake hands why。

Because it really allows you to assess how receptive someone is it gives you a good assessment of the starting point right。

 how receptive do they see that I'm cool do they like me is there that that again that value or the comfort there so say it put my handout。

Some people might not reach for it， some people just like， hi， some people won't even maybe say hi。

 I'm like， oh hey， I me， they just look at me。Then I know， oh， that's where I'm at。

Right some other ones， they might already be hooked to have me talking and I put my hand out and they put it and give me like oh hey with a huge squeeze great。

 that's where they stand already hooked so maybe I won't have to do as much here Some others might reach out and just do a very polite you know depend how hard are they squeezing how how much do they care about this handshake。

Tons of data from there。Okay， and then from there。You can see who you still have to really hook and it also shows you how receptive who's going to be to what you're saying。

 how big this sweet spot is。So you want to make that general assessment。Okay。

 going hand in hand with that general assessment。What's the group's hierarchy。

 how do they all know each other who would be say the leader of the group。

 who would be the number two person of the group， who would be the more people pleaser of the group who really sets the tone of the group and the same principles that we already covered here apply right if you think of identifying the hierarchy within a group who has say the most value who has the most say because that also plays into it right you look at how everyone receptive but this also plays where perhaps the person you're talking to say very receptive。

And someone else isn't as receptive， but within that group。

 that person has the most value that will determine how much。Contributes to the general sweet spot。

Get it， so I know this is really complicated and complex。It'll take a while to internalize。

 but person with most value has most influence in terms of affecting the general group sweet spot。

 so you got to be aware of that and you can follow where's value， follow the magnet， track their RAS。

Who， for example， is speaking more when they speak， you see everyone else。

Tune into what they're saying， care more about what they're saying。

React more to what they're saying oh， that's the main person， okay， great。

Determine the hierarchy and then the main or main people。You have to get them on your side。

So you'll want to also spend more time。With them than perhaps others。 it'd be much more beneficial。

Then spinning plates theory， I keep them all engaged。

And this is another key skill where you'll practice at first talking to one person。

 it's just one on one， but then when you're talking to a group， you want all of them engaged。Okay。

 and I really view it， you've heard me use this theory a lot right it's like spinning plates where it's like once you got one plate spinning。

 it allows you to also focus a bit more on the other person and put some momentum into spinning that place plate right getting them hooked。

Well this one keeps on going， but it might slow down right if you're ignoring this person something that become a little less hooked remember shades of being hooked so that once's this one spinning。

 you go back to this person spin it some more that's still spinning then you might spend a second here get a third plate spinning and you're playing this constant spinning plates。

Okay。Um and that also applies to when you're you're talking it's like eye contact with everyone。

 not just one person， you got to keep them all engaged and you have to develop that larger awareness where you should sense how every single person in that group is feeling you should also sense and see if someone suddenly starts。

Going out of the shades of hooked， losing interest， right in that case。Talk to that person there。

Right so， you know， you can do an exercise I would do with clients way back in the day is say。

We're all sitting I'm like hey， tell us a story and keep us all engaged and then I would like purposely for example。

 pull out my phone and it's like， hey， why are you not calling me out for being on my phone and it's not necessarily calling you out like get off the phone but it's like why don't you say something that hooks me？

But had an easy thing someone could say is， so you know what I'm saying， right？There you go。

 just pointing at me and be like， so you know what I'm saying， right， like suddenly involving me？

Like， oh， you know， right？We're just saying my name we're mentioning something of that suddenly hooks me back。

So you're going to want to do that or even just looking at someone pointing to someone as you're talking。

Right there's this crazy thing right so say say I'm telling a story about like。

You know the the live events I was doing right so like you know I was doing this crazy event and by the way。

 like we broadcast it live did you， do you happen to see it on on YouTube pointing to someone that'll hook that person plate spinning back to the general group still going stare to stare and but like keeping them all there。

Okay。😊，And then you want to balance that as we also discuss where if it's a person you truly want to connect with and form a deeper connection。

 you will want to maximize the one on one time， but even then it's like when you go in in the first few minutes it's like bangang bang bang。

 everyone likes you， the plates are spinning。And then you can maximize one on one if it's just two people and it's actually a lot easier if it's a big group because then you can talk to that one person all the others just keep on talking if it's two people you'll have to always engage both if you ignore one for too long it'll be a lose for the group and you'll lose two one thing you can do here in terms of group dynamics that also really plays on。

Situational confidence of having social alliances， but also social proof is merge interactions。

If you're meeting new people， talking to people， introduce everyone to everyone。You do this。

 this is literally like the magic pill when it comes to socializing。

 if I go to gathering a party networking business， you name it restaurant。

If you just start merging everyone， you position yourself in the。Place where you have the most value。

 massive social proof， everyone's all excited， it's insane。

 So what is merging interactions means it means being the introduce right， so you meet this person。

It could be introducing them to your friends， it could be introducing them to another person you already talked to it's like merging interactions。

 the more you are the introduce， the more you are the connector。

 it places you in that position of value。And it also hits on a lot of social proof。

 which also increases value， which we previously discussed right it's like the Amazon reviews whenever you buy something on Amazon you always look at the stars right how many people reviewed what's the rating if you get amazing rating or anything like Yelp a restaurant。

You're you' already bought in right it did if you're like， okay。

 I'm already re skepticceptive to this so having people you're with。

Creates massive receptivity this is something。In terms of forming connections that I did all the time and still do。

 but I did all the time when I first moved to Los Angeles and I would go out alone a lot。All right。

 so say you're going out alone。You can do this right you talk to someone and then you say hi to someone else and you simply introduce them。

And you can literally reach a point where you've now introduced everyone to everyone and you become the person who just looks like。

 you know everyone， even though you don't and you're alone。So I do a ton of this right introducing。

 and then you can even create a hub where what I would do if you're out say socializing and you're with some friends。

 what a lot of people do is they all go say hi to the same people right it's like your group says high to this group and your group says high to this group。

When I go with my friends， we don't do that， we go to one area and then it's like， oh。

 let's go say hi to people and then we all bring those groups back to that area and introduce them to each other。

And creates this huge hub right oh， say my friends that hired that group I said this group now we all introduce。

 oh hey， these are my friends my friends my friends oh hey。

 these are also my friends it's like it looks like I know everyone there。

And I'm leading position of value， massive social proof。This here。

 if done right again it will highlight the foundation if you're doing it as a try hard thing。

 you're screwed， but it's just a really fast to jolt things up and literally get to know everyone real fast and creating massive value and massive social proof okay creating a hub and it's super easy hey meet my friend。

Just that， hey， meet my friend。Or hey， let's go say hi to that person。

So you can just go say hi to someone else with someone you just met。

And it's also exciting in their lives because very few people。

We're able just network like that with others who they don't know right they're just kind of isolated it's very exciting it's oh we're going on this adventure oversing hi to someone oh great yeah。

 creating a hub merging interactions。Game changer。 you can do this in a venue。

 You can do this even in the street。 right， I've done it again， outdoor mall just， hey， hey。

 nice to meet you， hey， come on in just create this huge hub and it can be done within minutes。 One。

2 minutes。 bangang。 you have like a group of 1520 people around you。😊，If you do it right。
