# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.3 你的价值

In terms of your value。You understand the dynamic fall the magnet effect。

Then you have to ask yourself， okay， well， how can I bring the magnet towards me。

What makes me valuable？Overall， your value， the number one thing that makes you valuable as a person。

As cheesy as it sounds is your authenticity， your uniqueness。

That is the one thing that no one can beat you at。Right， no one can beat you at being you。

That's the one true， unique thing that you can offer this world。

If you try to find it in how much I have or money， there's always going to be a bigger fish。

 You can't win that one。But I being you， yeah， you can。And that ultimately。

 if you think of legacy on the world， like， that's the ultimate legacy。 is like。

 did people experience the real you。Did the world get to see and react to the real you？

So realize that that's the overall value you don't need to compensate with all these other things at a core just who you are the one thing you are the best at。

 no matter what is you being yourself。Playing the the game that is you right that's also why if you try to imitate someone you're just this poor version like the cheap version of that person。

But if you tap into that authenticness like what would like you， the only thing that you can。

Provide based upon your unique upbringing your unique DNA experiences interpretations。

 that's the one thing only you can provide okay your uniqueness and it's always important to remind yourself of that like。

The most valuable thing is my quote unquote B that's why people watch even say the Joe Rogan podcast of course people watch it for the information。

 but for the most part they just watch it because they enjoy experiencing Joe Rogan Joe Rogan talk Joe Rogan interview ask questions。

 the by behind it， the atmosphere， the look of it， that's what they really like。

If you take to arogan， it really doesn't matter who the guest is。Right， for the most part。

 it might play into your situational value where you're like， oh， I really like when there's。

More guess thinker guess right more like say a Jordan Peterson or whatnot like that versus a UFC fighter guest that might play into it。

 but overall you'd still enjoy it just because it's Joe Rogan and only he can provide that unique experience the same with me right when I have videos out I could probably start a cooking channel and some of you would watch it not because you're super into cooking not because I'm the best at cooking at all but because you'd enjoy just the experience of and I'm not saying this in an obnoxious way。

 but if you're used to watching me and you enjoy it like you'd enjoy the experience of me talking about cooking right or if I made a movie review series。

 a video review series， a TV show series and I'm just breaking it down you just enjoy it because it's more of just me。

That's what you got to start doing all the time it's like my core value is just the unique experience that I can deliver all of you here when you talk。

 for example make I'muting you and you're talking only you can deliver that experience to us here。😡。

No one else can replicate that going deeper， though。

It is very important to bring your awareness to what do I have going for myself。

And exercise I highly suggest you all do is writing down a list of features and benefits。

Personal features and benefits， What are your features or even unique features？

And how are those also benefits， how are those benefit people who meet you who interact with？

Ultimately， what value do you have to offer？Say someone decided to be your friend。

Someone decided to date you， get into a romantic relationship with you。

 someone decided to work with you， what value do you bring to the table？Everyone knows。

The value they want from others if I take all of you here I'm like okay。

 what are you looking for in a business partner， what are you looking for in a friend。

 what are you looking for in a romantic relationship you all know oh I want someone whos this this this is this I don't want that。

Okay， great， you know what they're bringing to the table。Let's just say you meet that person。

 what are they getting out of being with you or working with you or being your friend？

What's the value exchange？And you have to get clear on that。

And this comes down to analyzing who you are doing that deep audit okay based upon who I am you could start simple right a bit superficial like。

 what are some unique skills or some skills that I can provide what are some unique experiences that make me some things that I've gone through that you know would actually help what are some things about my personality about who I am as a person just make a list。

And then from that differentiate features benefits features is the thing。It's like， oh， you know。

They they would like me because I is an example right I've read a lot of books right that's something I bring the table I read a lot of books great that's a feature you've read a lot of books you know a lot of information feature。

The benefits。And for this， always ask yourself if you're the other person。Why do I care？

That's the comeback to any feature， imagine the person tells you， oh， that's your feature。

 why do I care about that？Oh， you read a lot of books cool， why do I care？Oh。

 you know a lot of content great why do I care， oh you're very smart， great， why do I care？

Explain it， oh， you care because this will help you in this way that way and that way。

Right oh you you care because this will benefit you in this way this way this way right and this goes back to what we talked about here before where you know never assume that they know how value equals survival reproduction good emotions you'll have to explain this sometimes to them。

And that is where you once more features， benefits， features benefits。

Same with letting go right even if you take a lot of my videos on YouTube or any kind of promotional content when it comes to letting go。

 what am I doing， I'm explaining how letting go helps you。

I don't assume that people naturally know this and guaranteed probably a lot of you didn't know that until I explained it to you you're like okay Julian's talking about this letting go thing and then you see some video I'm like okay letting go actually helps this and itll help you with your confidence and self-esttem and then in social skills do you deal with this problem this will happen after I started letting go etca you're like oh letting go is very beneficial let's let's learn how to do this。

No one's going to be like， hey， you want to learn how to let go？

You're like what does it do I do you just sort of have to let go it's awesome right people will sometimes use very vague benefits like it's awesome。

It'll make you feel good， you'll like it， don't do that。

Get specific and what specific way will this thing this feature benefit that person's survival reproduction good emotions and just this list alone。

 by the way， will eliminate a lot of self sabotage because what i've seen and this is so crazy is that。

In any social situation。We tend to always know what we want from the other person we're talking to。

 right， if I networked this person， Oh， my business would really go up。 Oh， I'd love to， you know。

 be friends with this person。 They seem really fun， et cea， et cetera。 You know what you want。

 But we rarely pause and ask ourselves， okay， this is what I want from them。

 What do they get in exchange。😊，What do they get from me。If you're like， I don't know。

 we're not much。 We're nothing。Then you will self sabotage。Out of decency。Where you're like， well。

 if I'm gonna get all that from them and they're not getting anything from me。

 They're getting this rotten deal because I don't want to screw them over。

 I'm just gonna self sabotage。So you got to get clear on what are they getting from you beyond that。

There are valuable characteristics， all of these。Sub communicate value okay。

 so for example social intelligence this one is a huge one right it's like oh this person and this can also go into your features and benefits right social intelligence that'd be the feature oh you know how to read social cues you know how to get around socially great。

Then the next question for you is how would that benefit the person， so in reality。

 for all of you here when you make this list。You should be writing down technically 100 things right。

 50 features， 50 benefits for each feature。So social intelligence。

 how would that communicate value right oh this person knows how to read different social social situations。

 read how to navigate situations， how to move up like gets a feel for what's going on around them socially then guess what that would definitely increase survival chances because this person's not going be so dumb that they'll say or do something dumb that'll mess everything up。

 will probably increase reproduction or if kids would be smarter and good emotions and success like it's extremely valuable especially nowadays social intelligence is lacking more and more。

 this is for me， by the way， if I even look in any kind of higher。

Number one thing I look for beyond even the skill。There's a lot of skills。

 especially if someone's socially smart， they can learn。Um， some spoty yeah。

 you need a certain amount of skill， but for the most part， it's like， is this person socially savvy？

And it's really， really hard to find people say very uncallibrated things。

 they'll say things the raised red flags， they say things are just killed the vibe。

 which they' are like， oh you really said that Do you drops immediately would you ever try to rely on someone where you know that they have no social intelligence？

No， because they would not be able to navigate this world。 It's way too risky。

 Low social intelligence， doing something that's out of line that's not appropriate to the context of a situation or conversation。

 extremely low value。Having a strong reality is very valuable。Oh。

 this person is actually very grounded。 They know who they are。 They know what they value。

 They know what they want， versus paying externally。Being confident。 Being non reactive。

Being at the cause。Having a certain amount of valuable knowledge。All of those are characteristics。

 you can write them down。Good questions。 Ask yourself here， too， is。

 what are you proud of in your life？If you can't answer that， again， it's a big problem。

 what are you proud of？We talked about how value also。Is anything that causes good emotions。

 If you want to zoom in on that。It's three things。Fun。Carefree。Passion。Good emotions， fun。

 carefree passion。These three things are extremely valuable。Everyone wants to have more fun。

Everyone wants to be more carefree。Everyone wants to be excited and passionate about something。

It's another key question， what excites you in life， Most people have no idea。

Learn how to generate this within yourself。And people want to。Be around you。

They will see value in you because， hey， if I'm around this person， I'll experience fun。

I'll experience carefreeness。 That'll rub off on me。 I'll experience passion。In this。

 you will have to learn it。When it comes to you， what do you find funny。

That's something to start auditing。Right， audit your day to day life and ask yourself， okay， today。

 when did I laugh， When did I genuinely laugh。How can I be carefree？How can I experience passion。

 What am I excited about？Okay。Fun， carefree passion。Remember here too。

Value potential is equally as attractive as having that value。Meaning。As an example， you could be。

Having already made it， say a business setting， you're now a successful business person or you're not yet。

 but you're on that way there。 And， you know the path and the people you see， oh。

 they see the path for you。 You have that potential。

 You're going places That's equally as attractive and valuable as already being there。

 This is something I would remind myself of all the time。 say 1012 years ago。

Where at the time I was in LA， I was broke， I had no money had nothing， but what did I have。

 I was working on myself and I had a certain path ahead of me where people could sense this person is going places。

Right there's the potential of having value and this is why if you talk to someone and you could take two people right say。

In that context， all they care about is money right it's like save up someone all they care money。

 money， money， money they talk to someone who say has a lot of money， oh yeah you know。

 I' run this business I make a lot of money that'll light up。But say they talk to someone who's like。

 hey。You know， right now I don't have much money， but this is what I'm working on and this is my plan and this is what going to happen and they see the potentiality of it equally as attractive。

Value and potential value equally as attractive。 remember this too。Yes。

 be aware of it in others right， okay， what's their currency would be valuable to this person。

 general value， yes， be aware of it， but also remember this， your reality， your rules。

Don't use this and fall into the trap of now always trying to impress others。

Because now you're placing them on a pedestal， you're reacting to them。

If you have a very strong reality。What you find valuable will be what is valuable。So， for example。

 say you're talking to someone and。Let's just say they're into unhealthy habits， right。

 They're really into like， you know， drinking， for example， and smoking and whatnot。

 Well you might think is， oh， if that's them， you know， I guess that's one thing they value。

 even though it's not healthy。 So how would I communicate there versus going up and being like。

 oh yeah， I'm not into that。If you're like strong reality， strong frame， that's not what I'm about。

 they will actually be like， oh， I guess I want to live up to that person's idea。 Okay。

 I'll put aside。 So it's always a balance， You can't be like， my reality， My rules all the time。

 or won't connect with anyone。 So don't go just me and blind to others。

 but don't just go all others is not me。 It's finding that nice balance。 So this is a game changer。

 It's it's a flip of it and it's a bit of a caveat on what we covered here。 where's likey。

 you get all that great。 But I could actually go up to say someone who's super into business and say they're not into spirituality。

 The example I said。One is you could talk business and play into that frame and that's cool or。

You can go up and just be so confident and be like， oh yeah， you know， spirituality is awesome。

 du du du， and just so into it。The day will be like oh shit。

 this person that they're going to even start perhaps second guessing themselves and they're going to play into that and be like。

 oh Julian's currency is spirituality even though I don't give a fuck about that let me say things to impress Julian and impress that in the chase。

So a little bit of a magic subtle point there， okay， your reality， your rules。
