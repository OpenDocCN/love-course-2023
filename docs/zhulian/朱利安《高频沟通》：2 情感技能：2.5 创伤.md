Keeping those three points in mindã€‚Let's bring our awareness to traumaã€‚ Okayï¼Œ what is traumaï¼Ÿ

Basic levelï¼Œ rightï¼Œ We hear this wordï¼Œ it's becoming more popularã€‚

trauma is ultimately anything that is perceived as life threatening or too overwhelming to experienceã€‚

That will resultã€‚And a traumatic experienceã€‚So yesï¼Œ rightï¼Œ if you hear traumaã€‚

 most likely you think of warï¼Œ violenceï¼Œ abuseï¼Œ rightï¼Œ Yesï¼Œ that is extremely traumaticã€‚

 It's something that is so horribleï¼Œ so horrificã€‚ It's tooã€‚

 too much to handle and experience it's terribleã€‚Butã€‚What we fail to consider is thatï¼Œ yesã€‚

 that's terrible and traumaticã€‚ But what is point number two is a kidã€‚

You depend on someone to surviveï¼Œ and your perception is very limitedã€‚

So what does that mean for a kidï¼Œ something that us here today as an adult would perceive asï¼Œ menã€‚

 not traumatic at allã€‚As a childï¼Œ you might perceive it as very traumaticã€‚As a childã€‚

 say you're lost in the grocery storeã€‚Your survival is at risk nowï¼Œ you can't live on your ownã€‚

You might thinkï¼Œ wellï¼Œ I lost in the grocery storeã€‚ Imï¼Œ I'm aloneã€‚ I'll never find my parents againã€‚

Not necessarily trueï¼Œ but that's what you believeã€‚And you will experience that same life or death situationã€‚

 something traumatic too overwhelming to handleã€‚As anyone elseã€‚Okayã€‚

 so realize here that no one is immune to itã€‚ no matter how good your childhood wasã€‚

 every single person alive has experienced something traumaticã€‚Trauma is a part of lifeã€‚

We all go through itã€‚Once moreï¼Œ even looking backï¼Œ you'd be likeï¼Œ like childhood who was awesomeã€‚

 Okayï¼Œ what about the grocery storeã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo we've all experienced thisã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Children can be overwhelmed by what we usually think of as common everyday eventsã€‚

 It all depends on your perception and what does trauma lead to suppression or repressionã€‚

And this here is the bigï¼Œ bigï¼Œ bigã€‚First thingã€‚That stifles that real you from shining throughã€‚Okayã€‚

Frommaã€‚That is the first of three things that you're going to want to bring your awareness to and let go ofã€‚

So here are some common examplesï¼Œ rightï¼Ÿå››ã€‚You're in classï¼Œ rightã€‚

 you're in school and you speak up and maybe the teacher tells you to be quietã€‚

That there could be traumatic for a kidã€‚Even though as an adultï¼Œ you're likeï¼Œ ohã€‚

 the teacher just saidï¼Œ be quietï¼Œ you might have been speaking up at an inappropriate timeï¼Œ tooã€‚

 Maybe it was quiet timeã€‚ you're just likeï¼Œ yeah yaping about and the teacher is gonna teach you the rules and guidelinesã€‚

 heyï¼Œ it's not appropriate to be yaping about right nowã€‚ as a kidï¼Œ you're likeï¼Œ wowã€‚

 they don't approve of me right nowï¼Œ they don't like me right nowï¼Œ they mightã€‚

 if they don't like me in the classroomã€‚ I could get kicked out of the classroomã€‚

 If I'm kicked out of the classroomï¼Œ depending on my limited perceptionã€‚

 The classrooms the world and I'm gonna dieã€‚You could be yelled at at a restaurantã€‚

 You're with your parentsï¼Œ be quietã€‚ My parents so love me right nowã€‚ That's how you interpret itã€‚

 It's not trueã€‚ They just told you to be quietã€‚They don't love meã€‚ If they don't love meã€‚

 they could abandon me if they abandon meï¼Œ I dieã€‚Survival li kicks inã€‚Okayï¼Œ and once moreã€‚

 this will lead to you either suppressingã€‚Rightï¼Œ meaning consciously sayingï¼Œ whoï¼Œ let's takeã€‚

 for exampleã€‚The part of me that is loudï¼Œ rightã€‚So if you think of yourself asã€‚A holeã€‚

What you do is you create a splitã€‚Where there is the acceptable youã€‚

And then there's the unacceptable youã€‚Goodï¼Œ good childï¼Œ naughty childã€‚So you're likeï¼Œ if I'm loudã€‚

 it's not being accepted right nowã€‚The part of me that is loud is threatening my survivalã€‚

 Let's get rid of thatã€‚ And you put it hereã€‚ Let's never be loud againã€‚Rightã€‚Ohï¼Œ you knowã€‚

 for here's another oneï¼Œ rightï¼Œ when it comes to relationshipsã€‚

People find out is a kid that you like someone in class and everyone starts teasing and singing songsã€‚

 rightï¼Œ like Julian and Sally in a treeï¼Œ you and I remember likeï¼Œ oh my goshï¼Œ I'm going to dieã€‚

 not trueã€‚You interpret thatï¼Œ so heyï¼Œ the part of me that expresses any interest in someone elseã€‚

Let's put it right hereã€‚Might say a jokeã€‚Friends likeï¼Œ that's not funnyã€‚ let's never say jokes againã€‚

So we all create the splitã€‚Okayã€‚And this here once more is whyã€‚It's hard to be social here todayã€‚

And for a lot of peopleï¼Œ that split could be a lot more extremeã€‚

 where it's like this is the only acceptable part of meã€‚This is also why our confidence is just shotã€‚

Becauseuse at a coreï¼Œ you don't feel like you are good enoughã€‚

 You only feel like this part of you is good enoughã€‚

 And then there's all this unacceptable toxic you you got to get rid ofã€‚

And then what's the approach we takeï¼Œ we try to overcompens to build up the front to compensate for all thisã€‚

What if people see through meï¼Œ they'll see all thatã€‚Noã€‚And it's alsoã€‚

 even if you think of general conditioningã€‚Whyï¼Œ againï¼Œ you don't feel like you're good enoughã€‚

 because from the moment you're bornã€‚You believe it's not true thatï¼Œ ohã€‚

 my parents only love me when I'm being a good living by the rulesï¼Œ childrenã€‚ if Iï¼Œ if I a childã€‚

 if I say this or do thatï¼Œ they don't love meï¼Œ but that's not trueã€‚But that's how we interpret itã€‚

So everyone has experienced traumaï¼Œ and it LED to suppression or repressionã€‚

 where you just completely dissociate andã€‚You could say this is with a very traumatic experienceã€‚

 That experience never happenedã€‚ It doesn't even register consciouslyã€‚So that's the first thing thatã€‚

Stifles are true cells from shining throughã€‚
