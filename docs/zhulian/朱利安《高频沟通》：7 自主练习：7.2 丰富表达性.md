# 朱利安《高频沟通》：7 自主练习：7.2 丰富表达性

Exercise number two。Groups of two。 okay， we're going to save the groups of two the entire time here。

 What you're going to do is for 30 seconds each。 You're going to take turns here。

You're going to focus on your delivery， your passion。

 and you're going to talk about something logically very boring。

 and you're going to make it the most interesting thing ever。

What you're going to talk about is your journey from the lobby to this seminar room。😡，For 30 seconds。

Now， what's the short version？Got into the hotel。 Here's a lobby。 I took the escalator up。

 and here I am。Very boring， huh？Logically， it's not the most interesting thing。Make it interesting。

Question for you is， how are you going to make it interesting？There are many ways。

 you could do it in the delivery instead of being very monotone。 Like I walked up the stairs。

 and then I did this。 People are very monotone。 Montone doesn't even mean quiet。 by the way。

 you could be loud。 I walked up the stairs， and then I turned right， and I walked in the room。

 And here I am。 Okay， sure you're loud， but it's still very flat。😊，Add some range。

 That means be loud， be quiet， be intense。Take a step back。Pause， tuck fast， a little bit slower。

Add that range。Add your body into it。 instead of， so I walked in， and I'm a very statue person。

 and I don't know how I walked up because I'm a statue。 It's like， no no， like。

 put your body into it。 O it。Add some graphic in your description。

 instead of so I walked up the escalator。 I put my right foot first。And then my left。

And then my right again。And then my right again？Notice the most boring thing ever， Oh。

 you put his right foot and his right foot again。 Whoa， that's so interesting。 Like， notice， right。

Make it interesting。 Make it the most captivating thing ever。

 Imagine you're delivering Shakespeare on stage。😊，And in your mind， this is also very important。

Right now， the internals have adjusted to what you're used to。Meaning。

If you're someone who's been very stifled in life。Most of us have been。

Chances are you speak quite quietly。Chances are， you're not that expressive。

Chances are you're kind of。You know， close off。The internals， your mind has gone used to that。

 And you've started telling yourself， this is normal。He's speaking quietly。

 This is the normal volume。And you try to speak loud internally， it might feel like you're yelling。

But externally， it'll come off as if you're talking normally。You will have to swing the pendulum。

That's why I keep saying， imagine you're delivering Shakespeare on stage。

 It should feel over the top。 You're stretching yourself here。

 It should feel like you're delivering this character speech of yourself。 This version of yourself。

 You're like， this is where over the top。 They probably think I'm all weird。No， no， no。 internally。

 you might feel that。 And it might take a while for the internals to readjust， but externally。

 it will not come off with that， is that。I've seen it for years in clients。 It's like。

 speak up loudly。Hey， yeah， I'm doing it。Am I yelling， Am I going to get kicked out？

 No one hears you dude。No one， but I'm yelling louder。In my mind， that's like I'm whispering。

Groups of two。You have 30 seconds each。Bring the passion， even in your description。

 add different words， you can mix and jokes， voices， you name it， the most interesting story ever。Go。

 come on！Before we switch， notice one thing。Most people here。Staring through the audience。Your feet。

 your legs did not move at all。That there， no joke is a huge tell。That's part of being stifled。

We overlook at what do you mean？If you ever see me， whether it's on stage， whether it's socializing。

 talking to people， it's a dance。I am never doing this statue version of me。

Every time it's like 1 ft in，1 ft out， it's like， Im moving。 Your body dictates so much。

 Why do you think in videos， I'm like， this is Julian。Why do I do the karate chop？Why。That second。

Because it amplifies the delivery of the word of the verbals。

 Could I do it like that without the cry， This is Julian， This is Julian。 This is Julian。

 This is Julian。Put your body into it， own it like you should be communicating on all layers。

 all cylinders， not just mentally， not just verbally。Make sure your feet are loose。Lucy Guosey baby。

 30 seconds， next one， let's go。You。I do respect a man with his hands in his pockets。As long as， no。

 no， for real。 I actually do。 As long as you can still summon that charisma。

 I have my hands in my pockets here on stage。Can you summon it， give us your story 30 seconds？

So I walked up to the automatic doors and I said， open sesame。

And I walked through scanning the floor to see who I knew that was in the lobby。😔。

I saw a few people at the table。Decided not to go talk to them yet， I wanted to go up the stairs。

Went to the escalator， didn't see hot Chetos crushed on it like I did last night。

So I took a step forward， okay。Love it。 solidlid，7，8 out of 10。 volume， amazing。You're projecting。

 you're owning it， great。A fewew things I'd add。 One， when you're put on the spot like this。

 where are you talking to the entire crowd。 So make sure you're engaging all aspects。 Number  two。

 as we talked about。Legs moving， legs moving。 Remember， too， it's a dance。 right。

 when you're doing this exercise here， too， no joke。 if you compare it to sex。Ask yourself。

 if you were to view you。What do you think sex with you would be like？

And I'm going in and I'm just doing that， and that's all I got and is there any float？

There has to be， right， it's like there has to be some kind of flow to it。来是下。成か。

But notice it's like there's a flow there， right， it's all like stiff。

 like there's no hockey stick up in ya， it's like pull it out。Now with that in mind。Again。

 this is really impressive， really good。 Most people would be stifled on a spot。 so massive respect。

 but see if you can just do 10，50 more seconds， same thing， you can repeat it all。

 but just add that flow， make it so that everyone looking at you is like， whoa， if he did me。

 that'd be the best ever。告。So I walked up to the lobby doors。I said， open sesame。

 This is missionary position。 I want some kinky stuff。 Come on。I went entered the lobby。

 observing who was in。The seats in front of me and who is upstairs？And I went loose， loose， loose。

 loose， body， come on， dance， it's a dance。I took my first step， better， yes。

 man I took my second step。I took my third step。There was no hot Cheees on the four step。 So loose。

 loose。 You just need someone massageaging you whenever you talk to someone。 That's all you need。

 Just loose， loose， loose， Come on。I got to the top of the escalator。And I saw my buddies。

 and I walked up to them。 And everyone was having a good time。 We were excited to see the speakers。

 Now， one more tweak， more range。 right， It's like， I want some smiling。 It's like， you know。

 I walked up the top of the escalators， and I saw my buddies。

 and we were excited to see the speakers。 And sex with me be way better。 Make it better than that。

 Come on。😊，Come on。s hard compete。 limiting belief。 You got this。 Just smile， facial expressions。

 body， It's like embody the dance。 like you're walking up the escalator。

 even if you do it cheesily like， yeah， And then we went up。 and I was excited for the speakers。

 And that's what's up。 And like， literally， the whole time。 Come on。😊。

I was doing a sexy saun turn the escalator。 Yes， more， more seeing who I could see up at the top。

 and I saw my friends。And I went up to them and I said， hey， what's up。

 And we all started talking about what we enjoyed last night， and it was awesome。

 We had some life changing insights。 And one last thing you're gonna hate this beloved。

 this year for everyone， if you look very subtly where you're gonna notice is this is no joke。

 a good 9 out of 10 in a stifle paradigm。😊，Letting go will show you the way out。

 but we can temporarily spike his state。Here's what you're going to do。You're going to say out loud。

And。It's a weird exercise， You're going to say out loud。I'm strong。 I'm confident I got this。

 and you're gonna say it's so loud that I want you to go beyond yourself beyond your ego。

 and you're gonna say it again again until I tell you go。 when I tell you go， that's when in my mind。

 I'm like， you're loud enough。 So you're gonna announce it to the crowd。 I'm strong。

 I'm confident I got this。 when I tell you， go， you crack back into your story。 Okay， going。

 I am strong。 I am confident。 I got this。 You can do way louder。 Come on。 I'm strong。

 louder I'm confident。 I got this。 tell it to the crowd， not just me。 I'm。 put your body into it。

 confident。 I got this。 now notice this。 I'll give you a little bit of permission。 I'm strong。

 I confident。 I got this。 Come on。 I'm strong more。😊，More， beyond yourself， more。20 times more。

 come on one more， you're almost there， even more， one more。I confident went back down more one more。

 one more come on body in one more all out。Now。Go story。

I walked up to the escalator I saw my friends at the top I started walking up come of a smile come excited about the speakers we learned so much yesterday and I went to talk this。

And it was fun and we were excited to see when those were going to start because it was late all the a couple days。

 but we went in and it was fun， we got our seats， we put our bottle on the ground to。

Cover our seats and we did it。👏Now。👏It's very subtle， but you notice even once he broke through。

He didn't even have to realize so much on the but but。 but it was like just so authentic。

 It stood out。 Anyone notice the difference。If you didn't， that's your stick point， by the way。

You don't know what to aim for。 You don't have the emotional intelligence to recognize what to aim for。

Huge， a lot of people are in apathy live in their heads。 they can't recognize it。 They're like。

 what's the same。 He's just loud。No joke， that's how they interpret it。 Well， he's just loud。

 he's just a little bit louder， Okay， cool。They don't get in touch with the soul。

If you ever listen to music， cause song， same thing， There's a certain soul。 Yeah every song。

 you can recognize the difference in that。 step one is learning how to reconnect with the soul within you。

 get out of your head。Then here you'll see subtleties。 That's what every single one of us。

 by the way， connects to。You want something engaging is not the words， iss that。

And notice how when you blast through， it's like your ego will constrain you， you blast through。

 It's like liberating。 This is also why people get hooked on social anxiety challenges。

 You do something that's out of the norm and you're like， yeah。

 you experience a certain amount of freedom。Or even when you get some disapproval， you're like。

 well I don't even care anymore。 Theyre already mocked me， whatever freedom。

That's what we all resonate with the key， though， is。Learn how to be like that by default。

 That's letting go。That's the emotional skill side of things。 But then， of course， yes。

 you can perfect it with what we talked about here。Okay， practice at home。

 look at yourself in front of the mirror。Every day， all these exercises whether you have a friend。

Whether some of them you do solo， you wake up from the mirror。 So I woke up and I walked to the c。

 and I'm holding my toothbrush b like， make it interesting。

Especially if you're tired and you just woke up and you're stled。 You're like， just out of bed。

 go to that mirror， half asleep and own it。And it doesn't necessarily mean。

 and this is huge that you have to be super， super loud， Funny enough。 if it's congruent。

 you can't fake this， But if it's congruent， you can also do this being very chill， right。

 Look at some interviews of like rock star celebrities， right， for example。Take Jared Letto， right。

 whether you're like him or not， look up some interviews。And I a friend who toured with him。

 we did a lot of videography for him。He's an interesting fella behind the scenes。 But the， the。

 what you see publicly is in interviews he comes off is like the softest， sweetest person ever。

 No joke。 He'll， he'll sit down。 He'll be like。😊，Oh you want to interview me Yes， so like， Jare， Ja。

 Ja， tell us about the song you composed。Without the dance。Now， there is a subtle dance。

 you won't see it。Straight forward， he'll sit down by。The the song， is that what you want to know。

I was in my home。Place an L。And sometimes， you know。Something speaks to you。Right， speaks to you。

 And there was a。Something from the。Beyond the just genome。Came to me， and the notes just。

Just flowed out。I knew I how to make， you know， make it to this album。

 I didn't know it would be the hit， but。I thought of my mother。And。You know。She inspired it。

 And sometimes you got to go beyond yourself。And beyond that。And that。And sometimes。Just sometimes。

Even beyond。And I know you're probably thinking， this is pretty chill。But you know。

 sex with this would be pretty good。As an example， it's a contrast。👏All， so。My。

My point being is always embrace what you physically feel， right， You'll see it， too。

 Like when I give events。Speeches， sometimes it is very bang， like in your face。

 Sometimes it's a lot more chill。 Sometimes it's funnier。 It's more like a comedy show。

 Sometimes I'm just sitting down。 It's very serious， very introspective。

 What dictates that Ultimately， at a core。 It's what I feel。But I will play into that。

 and I will dance with it。 I will channel it。And I will be much more in tune with that versus the words that I'm saying。

 The words that you say are simply the vehicle for someone to experience you。

Even in this interview here， the fake interview， the mimic of it。

Do you even remember what I said verbally？Do you， something about the mother。

 Like I guess the mother might have inspired him， I guess or something like that。

RightThat's all you remember。Yet everyone was hooked in。It's the soul。

The soul is the foundation that's the 80%。Then there's a 20% technicality you can add on to it without the soul。

Doesn't matter。You'll see this with musicians， too。 You can compare so much of socializing。

 connecting with people with music。 You'll see people who are like super technical。 Like， like。

 I play the guitar。 They're like， do it， but they just have no soul。 and they suck。

Look how fast I can play。 Look， don't I do all the perfect things， but there's not that feel。

Bring the feel。The feel is the foundation。And then what's better than just the foundation like winging it。

 Yeah， adding the technicality。Same here。Something so boring forces you to only rely on the field。

Do this every day。For a month， two months， three months， six months a year。

 what do you think will happen？
