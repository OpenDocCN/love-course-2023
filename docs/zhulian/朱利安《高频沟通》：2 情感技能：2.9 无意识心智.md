# 朱利安《高频沟通》：2 情感技能：2.9 无意识心智

We talked about。That split。There's the acceptable you， the unacceptable you。

It is also very important to understand in terms of how we work， right。

 that there are two worlds inside of you。All right， here's another model。There is。

You could say the conscious mind。And then， there's the。Subconscious mind。 Thiss what you're aware of。

 This's what you're not aware of。A lot of people will use an iceberg as a metaphor to explain this。

 If you just Google iceberg subconscious， you'll see tons of。

Pictures of icebergs where above the water is what you're aware of。

 And then there's this whole body of information underneath the surface。 We all have this。 Okay。

 a gross simplification would be the conscious mind is 10%。😊，The subconscious mind is 90%。

The subconscious mind。Is where you're going to put all the things you disowned？

The things you suppressed or repressed， anything that is unacceptable， Anything that you're like。

 this is threatening my survival。 This is not me。Because it's actually still you。

 Where does it go as far out of your awareness as possible in the pit of your subconscious down here。

And then there are going to be layers and layers of resistance to ever becoming aware of that。Now。

 this mechanism， by the way， conscious subconscious。 and again， this is a gross simplification。

It's good that we have these two worlds。Well you're aware of what you're not aware of。

Imagine you have to be aware of everything that ever happened to you your entire life right now in this moment。

 your head would explode。Right， be aware of every memory and experience right now。 It's too much。

So we do have that split。The same as be aware of everything you're doing automatically。

 unconsciously。 be aware of， you know， consciously right now， you breathing your heart rate。 So no。

 it's， it's good that there's this mechanism delegated to this subconscious。But we do use this。

To bury all those things。And this brings in the next big challenge， where。In order to。

You could say identify the trauma， the core beliefs， and the core identity。

You got to first be aware of it， and that's going to be。Under layers of resistance。

 you're not going to want to be aware of， for example。

 different traumatic experiences that stifled you。 You're not going to want to be aware of different core beliefs because it threatens your survival。

Once more， if that believes wrong， everything crumbles， same with your core identity。

So this is where we store it all， anything that's labeled is unacceptable。

There's a lot of resistance to becoming aware of it。 And this is key， although。

You might seem that because it's out of your awareness， it's not there。No， no， no。It's still active。

That's key。 Although what's in your subconscious is out of your awareness， it's still active。

 and it's actually even more powerful because whatever you resist persists。

And this is also why people who， for example， are really hooked on positive thinking。

It doesn't truly change because they're only working on the conscious。 Think positive thoughts。

 But all this stuff。 I suck， say that's a core belief you have around yourself， right。

 that core identity， that's been。Building momentum， power。

 And there's that charge behind it for a long time。 And the more you've been stuffing it down。

So a big part of it will be becoming aware of those two worlds， trying to identify what's down here。

Another key quote in the self help world is there's what you know。Conscious。There's what you know。

 you don't know conscious， right， Oh， I know I don't know the answer to。

But then there's what you don't know， you don't know。
