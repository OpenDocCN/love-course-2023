# 朱利安《高频沟通》：7 自主练习：7.1 摘下面具_ev

Exercise number one。This one's going to hit。On all of your defense mechanisms。

I know that little shield， that front that we are all conditioned to put up。That fear being seen。

That fear of people seeing who you truly are， what you're truly hiding。

 It's very easy to look cool for a second。RightTo hide behind some action， behind some words。

 behind some stories。Here's this exercise。You're going to stand facing each other。

And for five minutes straight， you're going to look into each other's eyes in silence。Now。

A few words of warning。There's a reason There's the cheesy saying。

 The eyes are the windows into someone's soul。 It's very true。

You're going to probably notice a lot of resistance。 The way it'll manifest is in a lot of cringe。

 a lot of uns， a lot of， oh， this is too much to handle。 You just can't let it land。

 And the way people will tend to deflect is in a few ways。 Number one， they will laugh。😊。

That breaks the tension。That's a defense mechanism。 Someone staring in your eyes like， ha， right， Ha。

 like kind of looking away。If you have to， that's fine。

 But challenge yourself to really stay with it。Number two is people will retreat in their minds。

 They'll start thinking of other things。 Oh， I'm staring， but I'm not really present。

 I'm thinking of this other memory and this other thing， trying to escape the present moment。

And the third way is people will focus on little subtleties on the other person's face。

 They'll fixate on the physical。 Instead of looking into their eyes and truly connecting。

 they'll look at， oh， you know， there's a little dot here on this eye。 Oh， there's a little wrinkle。

 and they'll focus on that。See if you can truly look into that person and let them look into you。

And whatever gets triggered， that's great data。 If there's that urge of， oh， this is too much。

 That's great data。 Stop hiding。Face each other。Five minutes might seem short， but trust me。

It may feel like a long time。Everyone ready， this is going to be done in silence。Moving close to。

D close as you feel comfortable。If you're crossing your arms， don't cross them， remain open。

 if your hands are in your pockets， take them out。See how comfortable you can get。This here。

 by the way， when it comes to socializing， connecting with people， creates a ton of self sabotage。

 that fear finally being found out。This is why a lot of people， they're not truly social masters。

 They're social scammers。 They're really good at perfecting affront and imagery。

 you hide behind the story and these cool things。Now， drop the front， drop the defense mechanism。

 can you allow yourself to be seen， be vulnerable， truly seen， five minutes in silence， go。

Give each other a high five， welcome each other back。Ait the thoughts that kicked in。

Audit the mental dialogue， audit the sensations， the emotions， how did it feel， How was it？

Are you able to say centered and present， Are you retreating in your head。

 Are you focusing on the external。 Could you let someone truly see you， Could you open up。

All that very valuable data。
