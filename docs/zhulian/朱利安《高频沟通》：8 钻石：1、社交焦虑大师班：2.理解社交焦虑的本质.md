# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：1、社交焦虑大师班：2.理解社交焦虑的本质

The first thing to understand is that social anxiety is good and necessary， okay。

 screw people who are all about no fear， right， no fear。

 no anxiety that is terrible that is toxic that is not natural okay。

 the same with that goal of I just want to get rid of this completely， no you don't。Okay。

Re that every single emotion is valuable and necessary， okay。

 it's part of your emotional guidance system。If you didn't experience say fear， what would happen？

You would be dead， you wouldn't be able to survive。

 you wouldn't be able to navigate this thing called life what is going to let you know that theres perhaps a threat if you didn't experience fear you would have no idea there's a threat。

be like， oh， all is good， that's not good right if someone pulls out a gun points it to you。

Do you want to be experiencing fear？Of course。You'll also see this in the more spiritual community。😊。

People are like， how do I let go of like， you know the fear of death like why do you want to let go of that right it's good to have fear around dying or what's going to keep you alive。

Okay， so every emotion is good， the same with anger， what does that say oh。

 a boundary has been crossed。Right what if you didn't experience anger people would walk all all over you。

 you would have no idea of what's okay what's not okay that would not be good at all either right the same with guilt people like I don't want to experience guilt well then how would you know that you did something that was out of alignment out of integrity in terms of what you care about and what you value。

Okay， you can think of these emotions as they just send this message， they send this data。

 it's like fear， threat， right anger， something's not okay， bring your attention， right guilt。

 you're out of alignment， out of integrity right the same with even grief right if a family member say dies。

It's normal and natural to feel grief， to feel sad， to go through that grieving period。No。

 everyone's like I don't want to experience no sadness anymore， oh， someone died， no， no。

 that's not normal， that's not good。Okay and you wouldn't want that either even in terms of your experience of this thing called life。

 a lot of it is through the body it's through feeling okay。

 so this isn't about getting rid of emotions or disowning emotions because that is ultimately what someone does right when they're like no fear。

 become fearless zero fear they're ultimately saying disown parts of who you are banish your emotions go against yourself。

Extremely， extremely toxic， that's not what we want。However。This is the big distinction。

A lot of us do confuse。You could say fake emotions with real emotions。This is the big distinction。

What I'm talking about here are real emotions right it's good to have those emotions where it's like here's the data。

 take the information， get the message like say you know you're driving I have this for example in my car if I'm driving and a car pulls out in front of me I'm going to get this red blinking light it was like right it's like slow down right even if I'm far away it'll do this blinking light thing。

I actually like that there's the blinking light。It's like again。

 that that's the emotion you could say even like anger， it's like bring your attention here， fear。

 threat， bring your attention here， beep big red light， great。However。

I love having it there for when it's needed。Here's the thing that happens with us in terms of our emotions is that。

There's the real emotion that's like the red light beeping when a car pulls out in front。

But when that car is out of the way and there's no one in front of me。

 the little beeping sound stops。For us， however。It doesn't tend to stop， does it？

Right very few people feel， for example， completely at ease。

 even when there's no reason to not feel completely at ease right it's like hey。

 there's there's no threats， why don't I feel completely at ease right now？😊。

Right and this is where you start shifting out of the real emotion into the fake and you'll see someone。

 for example， who might go through a breakup。And they'll go through the grieving face。

 which is normal which is natural you're like， oh it's sad you know there was a lot of shared history。

 shared experiences， you would not want to feel sad about that。But there is， again。

 the blinking light of sadness and grieving that might last a while， but eventually it stops。

What do we see though， people who still can't get over that X that that partner。

 they can't get over that breakup years later， if not decades later。

 right you'll even see people like in you know 70， 80 years old just still oh you know or sometimes even remarried and it's like oh my first wife。

 my first wife right can't get over it that there that's not the right amount， something is off。Okay。

 so that is where it's no longer real that's not appropriate to reality。

 that is what you want to let go of the same with you know。

 just how you experience the emotion there's duration that then also intensity right for example。

 public speaking a lot of people that's their number one fear right it's one of the biggest fears people have in life。

If you look at that situation， public speaking， so you were to go up in front of a stage。

 say there's a thousand people。The majority of people would just freeze just doing so me back in the day I would I would probably faint that's how scary that would be and if I audit that situation though。

Is there an actual threat？No， right， am I going to die if I speak in front of a thousand people。

 now what's the worst case that happens？People are like that wasn't too good and even if it wasn't too good。

 they probably just feel sorry for me like a poor guy did his best right it is funny too how our mind will distort it we're like oh they're going to judge and mock me and hate me now probably just gonna feel sorry for you okay that's the worst case oh perhaps a few negative impressions and then they forget life moves on and I move on with my life so my life really isn't at risk。

But why is it that back in the I would have felt like I'm about to die that's most people go up on stage。

Like that's not normal。Right that is not the real emotion that's when something got hijacked and it's。

Trigged you could say emotion it's unrealistic that is what you want to let go of okay and that's really the goal here with overcoming social anxiety when overcoming fear。

If you think of say， here's your reaction， like public speaking。

 here's all the amount of fear you experience。Perhaps this is the realistic amount that's the real emotion and then there's all this fake emotion added onto it that is what you let go of。

And this is big， so it's not going from all of this to nothing because then you went too far on the other side and again you've disowned parts of who you are your emotional guidance system。

 you ultimately turn into a sociopath that's not what you want you don't want to get rid of it completely you want to be left with the real amount and get rid of all the fake amount。

And like I mentioned。We tend to be so used to experiencing fake emotions that we've convinced ourselves those are the really emotions。

 no no no。Okay， and the real emotions， once more， they're temporary。

Right it's like the little light that pops up and you can always handle them it's not so overwhelming that it paralyzes you and again just keeps you stuck in a more permanent state so this here is the foundation when it comes to really understanding social anxiety and what it means to overcome and let go of social anxiety。
