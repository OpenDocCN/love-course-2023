Letting go is how you work on the being directlyã€‚You want to start with the beingã€‚ Rememberã€‚

 and let it bleed into the doing and bleed into the habitã€‚ How do you work on the beingï¼Œ Let goã€‚

 letting goï¼Œ letting goã€‚Okayï¼Œ letting goã€‚ and actuallyã€‚

An external approach that you can add to this to is surrounding yourself with people who have that result in the beingã€‚

Being very modest because I've seen it for yearsï¼Œ if people spend a lot of time hanging out with meã€‚

And sayï¼Œ their being isn'tã€‚Is confidentï¼Œ just by proximityã€‚My being will rub off on their beingã€‚Okayã€‚

 now that doesn't get to the cause per seï¼Œ but you can couple that with letting goã€‚Okayã€‚

 and here once moreï¼Œ realize that 80% of it is simply getting out of your own wayã€‚Rightã€‚

 and it's funnyï¼Œ tooï¼Œ if we audit our livesï¼Œ how we are able to be socialã€‚

With people we do believe are either in the same league as us or we're outside their leagueã€‚Rightã€‚

 if you talk to someoneï¼Œ you're likeï¼Œ and don't really care whateverã€‚Things just flowã€‚

 But it's with the peopleã€‚ You're likeï¼Œ actually want to talk to that personã€‚

 I wantt network with that personã€‚ That's where you actually freezeã€‚So you're likeã€‚

 why can't I access that with the people I do want to talk toï¼ŸOkayã€‚

 letting go equals how to be a natural when it comes to social skillsã€‚ And anyone who tells youã€‚

That to work on emotional skillsï¼Œ it's not through letting go or that the majority is analytical skillsã€‚

 What are they teaching youï¼Œ They're essentially teaching you how to scamã€‚How to be a social scammerã€‚

 And that's sadlyï¼Œ the majority of advice out thereã€‚ Here's three tips to appear more confidentã€‚

 Just do this thingã€‚ Don't work on yourself at allã€‚Most advice is just teaching you how to scanã€‚

 how to craft a perfect frontï¼Œ how to be better than you areã€‚

 how to get results that you shouldn't be gettingã€‚Because you haven't put in the workã€‚

It all boils down to that old school selfhel saying to get what you wantã€‚

 you have to deserve what you wantã€‚Nowã€‚The approach to working on itã€‚

 because letting go can sound very vagueã€‚The first thing to understand is the problem with just be yourselfã€‚

You hear thisï¼Œ right What's the best adviceï¼Œ Just be youã€‚Nowï¼Œ that is actually the best adviceã€‚It isã€‚

 but here's the problemã€‚Most people don't know who they areã€‚They don't know how to be themselvesã€‚

 They aren't in touch with that authenticã€‚Noã€‚Rightã€‚As I talked about beforeï¼Œ if say you're bornã€‚

 rightï¼Œ You're hereã€‚ What's this worldï¼Œ And you feel like expansiveã€‚Things happenã€‚ And you're likeã€‚

 ohï¼Œ I should maybe hold back a little bitã€‚ I should be a little bit more shyã€‚ Whoã€‚

 this thing happenedã€‚ Okï¼Œ I'll be quietã€‚You craft the frontï¼Œ you cile yourselfã€‚

 and you've been living through that for so longã€‚ that you've convinced yourselfï¼Œ that's youã€‚Heyã€‚

 I guess me being fakeï¼Œ rightï¼Œ Heyï¼Œ if you act fake long enoughã€‚

 you will brainwash yourself into thinking that that's you being authenticã€‚

 So then when people hear advice like be yourselfï¼Œ you're likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ be the fake meï¼Œ okayã€‚Noã€‚

 so being yourself means be your real selfã€‚ Reconnect with that and be thatã€‚

And this is also how you can see how this can be misinterpreted and used as an excuseã€‚

 So just be myselfã€‚ Okayï¼Œ wellï¼Œ then I just won't take any actionã€‚Rightï¼Œ especially meï¼Œ rightã€‚

 like back in the dayï¼Œ very logicalï¼Œ very analyticalã€‚ rightï¼Œ If you do personality testsã€‚

 my personality type is I N TJï¼Œ withhole Myers Bririggsã€‚I'm naturally more introvertedã€‚

 I'm not the type of person who could usually just like beam like thatã€‚ And a lot of that rightã€‚

 you could argue and go deeperã€‚ Oh extrovert introvertsã€‚

 But the majority of that really came down to my conditioningã€‚And if someone told meï¼Œ heyï¼Œ be myselfã€‚

 likeï¼Œ I'll be introverted in logical and quietã€‚ Then It's likeï¼Œ noï¼Œ noï¼Œ noã€‚

 What if that's not who I truly amã€‚And this is what you have to ask yourself here is you who you are here todayã€‚

 Is this who you truly are as a personï¼Œ Is this how you were bornã€‚

 Is this how you came into this worldã€‚And if there's some friction or part of you is likeã€‚

 something feels a little bit off about being this version of meï¼Œ then realize likeã€‚

 this is actually me being fakeã€‚What you think is you being yourself is not you being yourselfã€‚

And this is hugeã€‚Okayï¼Œ and then when it comes down to that sayingï¼Œ rightï¼Œ fake it till you make itã€‚

 it's actually act real until you rememberã€‚ you're faking it right nowã€‚And thisï¼Œ by the wayã€‚

If it clicksï¼Œ it will not only improve your approach when it comes to bettering your social skills and connecting with peopleã€‚

 but also help massively even in terms of self help and general self improvementã€‚Oã€‚

 the whole problem in the self world is people think who they are at this moment in timeã€‚

 before working on themselvesï¼Œ that's them being realã€‚å—¯å—¯å—¯ã€‚okã€‚So realize thatã€‚ That's why letting goã€‚

 letting go is like go of everything that's keeping the fakeness aliveã€‚

The approach too is away from situational towards core confidenceã€‚Okayï¼Œ audits too in your lifeã€‚

What you really depend on for situational confidenceã€‚A question ask yourself hereã€‚

 too is say some magical genie appeared next to youã€‚ It was likeï¼Œ heyï¼Œ I'll grant you one wishã€‚

 I can give you moneyã€‚ I can give you looksã€‚ I can give you a lifestyleã€‚ I can give you friendsã€‚

 I can give you fameï¼Œ whatever you wantã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWhat would be the one thing you'd wish for that would say affect how confident you feel on a daily basisã€‚

It might not fix everythingï¼Œ but say you could get one wishã€‚

 And the challenge was increase your confidence by as much in terms of percentage as you possibly canã€‚

 What would it be For some peopleï¼Œ it'd be money for othersï¼Œ It'd be looksï¼Œ maybe be friendsã€‚Fameã€‚

 better jobï¼Œ passionï¼Œ you name itã€‚Ait thatï¼Œ audit what really shoves you in your headã€‚

What gets you stifledã€‚As we talked aboutï¼Œ it's a process of realizingï¼Œ not becomingã€‚Andã€‚

A key shift in thinkingã€‚Is changing whenever you ask yourselfï¼Œ what nowã€‚Change that to whyã€‚

So for exampleï¼Œ this is emotional skillsï¼Œ not analytical skillsã€‚

 but when it comes to emotional skillsï¼Œ say you're shyï¼Œ say you're stifledï¼Œ say you're in your headã€‚

What most people do isï¼Œ oh I'm shyã€‚ I'm stifledã€‚ I don't know what to sayã€‚ What nowã€‚Terribleã€‚Rightã€‚

 what is what nowï¼ŸIt's this approachã€‚ I'm down hereã€‚ What nowï¼Œ what nowï¼Œ what nowã€‚Change that to whyã€‚

 Ohï¼Œ I'm stifledã€‚ Why am I stifledã€‚And that shifts your focus away from what nowã€‚

 the buildup to compensate to what is the thing that's telling me I'm down hereã€‚

What is the thing that makes me stifled right nowï¼ŸAnd that shifts you to introspectingã€‚

That's a lot of the emotional skillsï¼Œ introspectionï¼Œ learning about yourselfã€‚Asking yourselfã€‚

 how did I become this fake front that I am here todayã€‚What's keeping it aliveã€‚

Right back to old school self helpã€‚Everyone uses thisã€‚ Not sure if Tiney Robbins was the firstã€‚

 but someone wasã€‚There's the tableã€‚And then there's the legs of a tableã€‚Rightã€‚

What people try to do if you're likeï¼Œ break the table is they try to bang on the table and you can bang as loud as hard as you canã€‚

 It's like nothing really is going to happenã€‚ What's the easiest wayï¼Œ Take out the legsã€‚

That's what we're doing hereã€‚ F frontã€‚ That's the tabletopã€‚What are all the referencesã€‚

 What are the experiencesï¼Œ What are the legs keeping it aliveã€‚That's why you do the Yã€‚

 Then you're likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ thatã€‚And it fades awayã€‚
