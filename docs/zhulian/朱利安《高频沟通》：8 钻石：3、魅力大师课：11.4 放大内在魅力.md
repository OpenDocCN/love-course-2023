# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：3、魅力大师课：11.4 放大内在魅力

Now that you're aware of those 300 buttons， okay， that will naturally once more。

Start coming through the more you let go， you can also supercharge this。

 and this is why wrote down here， learn to push your own buttons。You have the fun button。

 the carefree button， the passion button， do you know how to push them。

 do you know how to generate fun within you？And I wrote down here， this must be summons。

 you cannot force it。Okay， you can't be like， let's have fun now。

 how can you generate genuine laughter， genuine just a fun vibes with it。Do you know how？

Could you do it right now？If the answer is no， then that is not good。Okay。

 this is something you must learn how to do， you must ask yourself here， well。

 how do I just generate fun？What can I say or do that will make me authentically laugh？Okay。

 so one key exercise here。That I've been telling people do for years is do an audit in your day to day life and look at every single time。

You laugh。Right。Yesterday what were three things you said or did and this is very important like you can also do oh that other people said or did that's fine what about you what are three things you said or did。

That you found funny。What about today， what about tomorrow， what about while out Oh。

 you talked to some people great， what were three things you said or did that you genuinely found funny。

Write them down。Write these down for a month， you now have 90 things。

You find funny then you can take those things and you can start compartmentalizing them and seeing the different themes what's your humor like right everyone's humor is unique。

 what exactly makes you laugh， what are the underlying principles or what do all these things have in common and how can you then take that and just generate things that make you laugh。

 things that generate that fun within you at will。And that's where you truly become invincible on the inner side of charisma。

Okay， I wrote down here too your superpower is creativity。

 people of charismatic extremely creative they use anything and everything。😊。

Whether it's in what they're saying， what the other persons saying， what the group is saying。

 what strangers are saying， what the environment， everything that's happening。

 they always use all that to push their inner buttons， whether it's fun， carefree or passion。

And once you learn how to do that， there's always a way if you're creative enough to see it。

 you really are invincible， this is once more on the doing side。😊，This is superchar it。

 this is that last 20%。You can't make this your foundation I've made the mistake in the past of making this my foundation and it is not sustainable okay you can't think that oh I'm not charismatic but if I just master the three buttons in creativity and it's always through doing I'll be charismatic no。

You should learn how to be charismatic without all this。

 and then you can use this to once more supercharge the inner。Okay， but。

That's the skill right that's also even how embrace exaggerate laugh plays into this right say something。

Goes a little awkward in an interaction， get creative how can you for example。

 laugh at that so it hits the fun button and by laughing at that you're even laughing at yourself in a way and by laughing at yourself what happens is also hits the carefree button。

So fun care free just hit by an awkward situation and an interaction。

For a lot of people if somebody goes awkward， they start self attacking， they feel bad they're like。

 oh why did this happen was it's just this downward spiral no get creative。Hey。

 there's more ammunition to hit fun carefree passion。And with passion。

 the other thing too is ask yourself， well， what are you passionate about， what turns you on？

What's some topic， something that you can just say where you just get carried away talking about it？

Right an example， my favorite example is a client years ago who talked about Game of Thrones at a live event and he just got carried away talking about Game of Thrones forgot the event was there right I even forgot the event was there everyone got sucked in because he was passionate about it。

😊，What's that one thing you're passionate about， whatever it is？

It's like well I'm really passionate about this TV show I'm passionate about cleaning。

 you could literally be passionate about cleaning start talking to people how you just love to clean you're like you know I just love cleaning just scraping stuff and cleaning stuff I just love it it's a very meditative process do that people will get sucked up。

Okay， again， these three things， fun carefully passion， it's not the words。

 it's the vibe underneath it all。So get creative。When things are not going your way， simply means。

 hey， perhaps you're not creative enough。Okay， and also learn to speak with your entire body here that's part of supercharging this right it's learning how to push those buttons so it just amplifies。

Must be summoned。And then speak with your entire body。

 don't just speak with the words right and you can audit once more when you're talking to someone are you very stiff are you very stifled are you like a statue or you in motion right even me here sitting down doing this masterclass like you see me my hands are moving my whole body's moving right and depending on the words like if I want to like my whole body's movement but even I say that body you know。

 I was amusful uncut jams I was Josh Saft's muse when he wrote uncutja like even the way I'll do a certain movement will be to accentuate a certain word right accentuate a certain word。

Versus accentuate a certain word。Acentuate a swing， accentuate。So getting in touch with the body。

 there iss also why inner work and letting go is so key， right， not just living up here， but really。

Taken up， you could say your whole vessel key。Okay， and I also what wrote done here， commanding。

 challenging， adding to the fund。This here， in terms of superchar the inner。

 what people tend to do is。How to say there's not enough excitement in the way they talk it is very flat so if you bring these types of vibes in your delivery it can spice things up right so for most people just very agreeable very people please or it's like oh in this on then this oh did you see this oh yeah and Game of Thrs this oh and this oh and Joe instead of speak with the entire body。

But if you add， for example， with commanding， it's like more of a， you know。

 just kind of that certainty in what you say it's like， oh yeah， and this。

Like leading kind of like taking the attention， oh yeah， being loud being certain spices up。

 you know， the talk versus just this kind of flat agreeable boring chit chat what about challenging right being playfully challenging at times disagreeing be likehuh are you sure？

Are you sure？Spices it up and then of course adding to the fun good vibes joking smiling like what？

Right spices it up a lot so this here is really。😊，The inner side of charisma， supercharging it。

 learn to push those buttons。Okay， learn how to summon that another just example for what it means to really summon this is if you're someone who's very logical right I also saw in one of the questions someone's like well my jobs you know I'm very logical in my job how can I just go out and tap into this and be charismatic I guess what I'm very logical my job as well right people think oh you social skills but I just always socializing well I am a lot yes。

 but for the most part。😊，I'm just beyond a computer working he's very logical right even putting like a class together like this it's a lot of logical thinking right it's analyzing reflecting researching。

 exchanging notess et cetera， et cetera， it's not the most hey。

 let's just fund carefree all the time right no。😊，So you know how a joke there's that old meme right it's like what your friends think you do which society what you really do just typing away so I'm in the same boat right when I go out I come out of a very logical space。

 however for most people that stiflessome for most peoplere like oh I'm so logical my day job how can I have fun for me that actually makes it easier because I'm like whoa。

Been logical all this portion of the day， let's milk this time out and not me logical and be social and be fun。

 it's like yes， it's like you're let out of the cage。😊。

Right if you're someone who's logical at work and then you go out and you have trouble breaking out of it。

 it just means you're addicted to the cage， you're addicted to logicality。

So for me that is actually a lot easier because of that and then what I would say is this is a great example of how you must summon this right if you're logical you're probably thinking what are some logical things I can say or do to have fun。

 but that's just fueling the logical thinking instead it's there's a wheel that's turning put a stick。

 learn how to pattern interrupt yourself。😊，Right， for example， as we talked about before。

 right it's like blurting out a random work thrown out of things to say。Star Wars。

 wait what Star Wars just blurt that out right or just randomly you' like， how's it going？

But the fuck was at right stuff like that that like it's is so shocking it snaps you out of that logical way of thinking that's how you summon that vibe。

 you can't force it， you can only create opportunities for it to be summoned and ultimately sneak up on you。

Okay。Literally， I don't know how I just thought of that， but that'd be such a funny way just he。

 how's it going like every time you say hi just right after just just own it like excuse me。

 I'm Julian。And just like as if nothing as if nothing happened so even that right in the moment like genuine laughter just by that right so that's the skill。

😊，You can't think your way into it。You can only pattern interrupt。

TheThe stuff that's blocking that and then of course。

 this is a lot more in the external ideally it let goes so there's nothing to pattern interrupt to begin with Okay。

 but this is superchar the internet this is the vibe， the emotional side of charisma letting it。

You know， come out and then superchar it。
