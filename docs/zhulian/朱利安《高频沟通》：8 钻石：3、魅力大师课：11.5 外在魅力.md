# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：3、魅力大师课：11.5 外在魅力

Without her charisma， becoming a caricature of yourself。That's really。The foundation of it here okay。

 what does that mean for you what does becoming a caricature of yourself actually mean and I don't mean this in a funny goofy way where I like oh like the little drawing where they do caricature no no no what is an amplified exaggerated version of you。

Okay， now once more this has to be built on authenticity， you better know who you are authentically。

What you're into authentically what you find fun what makes you can experience carefreeness。

 what you're passionate about and then on the external side in terms of texturizing that or in terms of how you express it。

 how can you amplify it to the point where it's just a caricature version of you so let me explain it this way okay if you look at myself。

And especially for example， the branding around who I am okay。

 if you've been following me for a long time， you've seen different shadows or different ways that I've branded myself and ultimately each of those ways is a caricature of me it's not really me I'm not like that for example all the time if you've been watching my videos online and it's say a video v I'm say out in a city traveling and I'm like this is Julian like I'm not talking like that all the time。

people are like does he he always like that can you just imagine I'm just like。

 hey right I call a friend this is Julian what are you doing tonight like no。

 I'm not like that all the time That is an amplified supercharged version of me it is it's based in authenticity right where yes if I if I'm like hey what does。

😊，You know， going in intense and just starting a video， just grabbing attention， like focus。

The way that I would authentically do it is how I do it So it's not fake。

 but it simply means it's it's supercharged it's on on steroids so to say right the same as。

For example， different attis right the charisma isn't just this is on the outer side right it's not just in what you say it's also you present yourself there's times where I wore。

 for example crazy pieces of clothing like from robes and so on and so forth and all that that played into my authenticity right where you could go deeper on this and we'll talk about it also plays into a humor side of things where I really love。

Breaking different。Anticipated patterns and messing with social conditioning or spiritual conditioning so it was played into that。

 but then it was also something that was authentic to me it was a caricconature version right does that mean that i'm wearing robes all the time no right does that mean hey if I go to the grocery storem to wear the robes and glasses and gold shoes and pants no。

😊，But。In terms of the branding and that situation， it's the caricature version of me and most likely if you think of myself as a brand。

 those are some of the things that pops out right some of the things that might pop out is。

Well one in the old school was this is many years ago， it was very shocking， a lot of shock humor。

 a lot of like really dark messed up humor， very provocative， very out there， very dramatic。

 very extreme right to the point where even people refer to that old version of myself as kind of like drama Julian。

 I see like evil Julian like weird names people give that there。That's chaismma。

 it's like if you think of that version of me， it's a caricature of myself。

Then you might hear people talk about， oh yeah， the robes， Father J， so on and so forth。

 there's another caricature of myself。Right。If you think of for example my friend Jeff right same thing he became this caricature of himself right he's wearing a headband he's really like he's this funny guy's driving this van。

 he's just kind of like this this wacky superhero version of himself in a certain way。Right。

 and if you think of any。Celebrity or any public figure that really stands out they all have that kind of caricature version of themselves right you know they're not like that all the time。

 but you can say oh this person it's it's like that type of person it's like say you have like the。

Try to think of this example like the。Like the let's just say there's five different heroes and each hero has a certain power。

 you can easily say， oh yeah the green hero is that power， the blue hero is that power。

 this that power you can say up in any celebrity oh this celebri there's that this has that oh Julian there's that oh Jeff there's that what would people say about you？

Say there was a celebrity version of you would be a rep。

What would be the things people would just associate to you？Do you know， or would it be， oh。

 there's just Blando Mc Blanderson over there？What would they say about you？

 another example I really love is if you go on YouTube。

You can look up a channel it's called Alex Beckcker this i've not really talked to him in recent years。

 but he actually did the very first video sales letter for my very first program back in 2014 right there's a video where it's like you know make sure you're your're。

Your sound is on and I'm reading through these slides so he helped a lot with the marketing on that a genius marketer he's more into crypto right now。

 but this is a guy where I mean I've seen him through the years。

 but even if you go on his YouTube and you look up some of his older videos and you look at the ones now。

 there's a great example of someone who really came into their own and became this caricature version of themselves。

I if you look at Alex Beckcker he's。Making all he has his own style of humor that he came up with uses his own words。

 his own way of talking， go back two three years very different right even before that very different too so that's how you should be thinking about yourself right if here you are right now。

 what's the supercharged version of you what's the celebrity version of you。

If you don't know what that looks like， that's not good。

 that's something to really start figuring out because that plays into charisma。Okay。

 what is the caricature version of you？Now， building on this， this also means reflecting on you。

 who are you？What's your personality like？What are some unique personality traits？

What are some unique things that you're into， some unique things that you like？Right， for example。

One unique thing that I liked and watched religiously back in the was this show called the Vapire Iers right it's like this cheesy kind of vampire。

Romance triangle chick flick show I love the show right and i'll talk about this later it does there's so much。

😊，Charismatic value to extract from that show， actually。Um。

 but that's like a unique kind of like quirky thing that I was into。

Now guess what I actually brought that in as part of my brand， I bring that in conversations。

 I talk about it in videos and if you've been following me for a long time you already knew this everybody're probably like oh yeah Julia in into the vampire Diaries。

Hey， that's part of the caricature version of me。Does it mean that I'm watching vampires all the time。

 no， but it's associated with me that's something that's a bit unique about me what's unique about you？

What are some even dorky things about you？Right like for me music wise again I love music。

 I really live for music been playing since the age of eight and I've been very modest amazing amazing musical taste。

 which you can find my。Playlist on Spotify， if you like。

 but then I also have a guilty pleasure where I'd like to playlists so the the one with the the real music and then have the guilty pleasure music where it's like kind of all these。

More of like kind of pop girl pop songs like even from like Britney Spearce to onenot and I really like that something is kind of quirky something is kind of unique a lot of people won't even talk about that and hey I would talk about in a lot of my interactions a lot of my conversations I bring that up or like musicals and stuff like that I love musicals right what's that for you。

Reflect on it right even reflect back on。Your childhood， right。

 like what were you into during your childhood， what were your interests？

Make a list of all that what are some things that only you are into that other people aren't into？

Some things that stand out。Some things where it's like， oh。

 that's just him or her or that's just that person。I can guarantee， for example。

 back in the day I started talking about vampire diaries。

 it wasn't expected from someone like me to talk about that or to be into that stands out。Okay。

When you see， and this is another key question， what's my version of that。

 when you see someone who is who you deem as being very charismatic。Who really tapped into that， oh。

 they became a caricature version of themselves， keep asking yourself， what's my version？

Don't try to replicate what they're saying， don't try to replicate what they're doing right like you might go for example on YouTube you're like oh the Alex Becker thing Julian said。

 oh yeah， so Alex Becker talks like that and that's his humor that's his tonality that's his jokes let me replicate no no no。

Never try to mimic or again， it's just not going to work you're trying to be a poor version of that that person。

 ask yourself and said well。Based upon the inner that I feel from this like what would make me experience that right what's my version if that person says this to feel that。

 what do I have to say to feel that？Really make it yours。

Charisma also really has a lot to do with standing out and being unique。Try to copy someone else。

 it's not going to be as charismatic because it's not as unique。So to be unique。

 you better reflect on what makes you unique。What are some unique things about you and it could even be。

Weird situations that only happened to you， the only you were in。

things that even maybe as you were younger， you hated， but now you look back it's like， huh。

That's an interesting thing that only I went through that no one else did， how can you harness that。

 how can you get creative and mold that into that supercharged version of yourself。Okay。

 and I wrote down here too the art of standing out in a relatable way。

 this is so much of charisma too it's you're standing out and you're pushing things a little further than most people would。

But in a way where it is relatable， it has to be relatable that's really also what。

A lot of celebrities do， too， it's like they do stuff that the average person wouldn't do。

But in a relatable way。系。They might wear， for example， clothes that the average person wouldn't wear。

But it's relatable because they're a celebrity， right so they get away with it。

Um that there again communicates massive value as well， but it's also a lot of charisma it's like。

 hey， can you be。Louder。In a relatable way， can you bring more passion in a relatable way？

Can you bring so much passion no one's ever seen anyone bring as much passion as you in a relatable way？

Okay and break down your in the zone references， what does this mean when you have those moments where you do come into your own like I said we all have those moments like you're born with a lot of this there's times where you might be out and you just get in the zone things just click and you're like yeah or like those times where you're maybe alone and you put the headset on and you're playing the video game and be app and about break down those references break down your charismatic references。

What were you talking about， how did you feel what was different？

That also give you a lot of clear direction in terms of what to aim for in the expression that is you。

Okay， and it is possible， okay， I remember being aware of this， by the way， just to give。

Kind of some behind the scenes insight way back in the day before I even started。Making videos。

 putting myself out there。And I was like， well， I can kind of see the trajectory of my life moving towards this。

This is even when I already was like well let me start the channel and I had this little blog I was doing where I was trying to write some stuff and I knew I was going to start making videos but I was too scared to make videos and。

The blog was called Julianlife。com there's like three four articles that was it I'm terrible writers ourselves like three articles and whatever。

But even with that， I was like， well， what's my thing？Right because I was like， well。

There's some people I'm working with and they already have their kind of brands right there was one who's like more of like the the crazy。

Kind of like party guy Australian there's my friend say Jeff right is kind of like the reverent like driving the band guy who was just really well worded and red but kind of comes off also is like just very nihilistic in a way there's Owen right who's again just very in to say health meditation that like that's all he talks about and it's like just can go on these crazy insane rants and kind of like this this wise guyss like all these unique brands I'm like where do I fit in right like what's。

What's my character version， like what's my superhero， what's my avatar？

UmAnd I there was a lot of fear it's like maybe there's like is there anything really special about me right this is before even like the whole drama Julian father J Julia。

 et cetera， it's like I had no idea and I thought maybe there's nothing about me like how can I even put myself out there I'm just going be the blandest person there。

 but that's not true。So if you're thinking that he I was there as well， you can do it。

 you can reach that point where again you are that caricature version of yourself。

 you stand out in a relatable way， you've really harnessed your uniqueness you've come into your own and people really gravitate towards that okay。

 this is the foundation of the outer side of charisma。
