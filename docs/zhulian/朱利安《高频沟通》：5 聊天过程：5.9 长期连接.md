# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.9 长期连接

Social media over phone number。Social media over phone number。

I'm not a fan of social media in terms of consumer culture。

 but in terms of a practical tool to convey more of who you are， a bigger sample of your personality。

It is very beneficial and very useful。 I would highly suggest using social media。

 not getting used by it， but using it。Where say you just have two。

 three minutes to talk to someone or connect with someone。That's it， due to some reason。

 then they have to go。Exchanging social media allows you once more to give that bigger sample once you both left。

And you can communicate so much about who you are， your personality， what you're into， value。

 comfort through social media， an extremely valuable tool。Now。

 I would still get the number if you can， but social media should always be the priority。

Now what this also means is social media is now your online resume。

Don't think of it as just like the consumer side， people， for example。

 create an Instagram account and just follow anything that they think would be fun to scroll through。

You can do that， but then ask yourself， if someone who I didn't know was checking out my profile here。

 what would this communicate？Oh hey， I want to make some business connections。

 what would they think if they go on my profile and everything I follow is just means？Right。

 doesn't mean you can't follow memes。 I follow some meme stuff。 But if that's all there is。

 is's like， oh， wait a minute。 where if they go on your profile and all there is is like dumb。

 funny party pictures and you just drunk on the floor， some crazy stuff。 or like。

 here's my new favorite anime show。 It's like， no， maybe not。😊，But then it depends also。

 it's like perhaps you do want to show a bit of that。Be smart， just think of it， that's your resume。

And just like with vibeing， you want to show a little bursts of everything。

 You don't want it to be too serious。 You could show like。

 this is my anime show as long as it's not just that。 But basically ask yourself。

In terms of who I want to meet and what context I want to meet them。

 what would help value and comfort， Social media is your online resume where they get to see。

You know， more a bigger sample of who you are， what your lifestyle is like， what you're into。

 your personality， yning。Um， so even if it's someone where maybe you just had like two。

 three minutes to connect。Social media exchange they learn a ton。Right， like no joke for me。

 you when it come say business networking or connections。

I literally just have to talk 30 seconds to a minute。

displayplay as much as possible exchange social media and then the social media allows for the continuation of that later that communicates all the things I didn't have time or couldn't do in the context of meeting that person initially so use it your advantage if you're not on social media。

You're going to be missing out on a lot of opportunity and you're making things way harder than they need be now you do also want to balance it this is more inner work side。

Where you're not now consumed to social media， use it as a tool， don't let it use you。

 but as a tool is an absolute game changer and if you're not on it， you are missing it。Okay。

 and be aware of。The different types of social media， best one is Instagram。

 go with Instagram always。People are still obviously on Facebook but Facebook is more groups and you know what we have on Facebook right it's like a lot of deeper discussions no one really hangs out or chats that much on Facebook anymore for the most part but depends where you live maybe where you live it does but find the one where you live I personally like Instagram the best for that okay so social media over numberumb and then Instagram Instagram Instagram okay and ideally you can get both by the way。

But if you can just get one， get social media。And make sure。

That when you do get the persons social media， if you can to send them a message on there directly so that they get it and accept it or they friend you back so there is the open line and you don't go into the message the DM request and you're actually in their actual DMs。

Okay， someone's like what about whatsapp yeah you can do whatsapp literally just like texting but social media is much more beneficial than text or whatsapp right and you can of course message through social media the exact same way but the benefit is the social media。

You have your whole resume right there at this point。

 you know you'll see a million in one courses for how to optimize your social media you can follow those and see those if you want。

 however。Don't get too paranoid at this right just make it good enough and everyone has an idea of what good enough looks like right what does it mean have some good photos right ideally nice high quality photos it doesn't you know not like an old grainy photo but it could also be artsy great if it's artsy grainy that's fine but just either artistic or high quality okay and high quality doesn't have to be a professional camera could just be your eye right and on there simply ask yourself。

If if my social media is basically the sales page of who I am and my personality。

 what would enhance that， what would highlight by features and benefits， remember the list we made。

 what highlights that， what conveys value， what conveys comfort。

 what stuff that would help increase receptivity and increase the connection。

All if you put something like just old and kind of low quality or there's just like two photos it doesn't communicate a much right so don't worry so much follower wise。

You don't need tons of followers right and that's really a question of frame too if when you're exchanging you're like。

 oh you know I don't have many followers but if you're like， hey， I only really connect to people。

 I truly love talking to and messaging。Great。😊，You can literally have 50 followers。

 you can even have 20 followers' be like， yeah， I really keep this to the bare minimum of the people I really just connect with。

Done strong frame done versus oh me you just like you know what say I don't really use social media I just use it to connect with people you know I don't like scrolling through tons of stuff so。

You know， you're now in the close， you're in the circle of trust。

 you can even say it's a joke like that， but don't get too worried about all that。

I don't get worried about having tons of pictures， but you want a good。Was it threes。

 I would say minimum seven。All， minimum seven。And ideally， more than that， the minimum seven photos。

All right， so there's at least two rows and an next row。Profile picture。

Best picture do have of yourself you all know again what's the most flattering best photo like put that。

 you know， a full face， not like a small body one because then it always looks a little bit sketch like what's this person hiding full face。

And then in terms of the actual posts。You want to apply the same principles we covered here right so I made some examples right so have value posts so posts that convey authority。

Right？Whatever that is， post that convey value that highlight features and benefits of who you are。

 so on and so forth， posts where there might be like social proof。

 say you're with friends right or you know through associations。

 like if there's any photos of people in general society of status in that specific instance that have status like anything to increase value。

 same with lifestyle right if you're traveling if you're doing cool things， convey all that。

Comfort posts as well。Um， value is more important， though。

 I'd rather have a lot of value and then I would balance out the comfort through reaching out。

Where when you reach out you're just super chill and just you know personal and vulnerable and that balances it out。

 but it is good to have both in there， meaning it's not just look at how cool I am it's oh but I'm also a human right so personal posts deeper posts reflections。

 things that show the different shades of your personality shades of who you are。

And then that also links to personality posts which you can add in like posts that you know are funny yet valuable not like just posting dumb me and stuff unless' stuff you're really into posts that kind of are a bit more polarizing passion posts right like posts of you on your purpose。

 something you're excited about with like the personal or funny posts that could also be like music you're into stuff you're excited about books you're into you name it's like oh this person reads oh this person's in the self-help you also convey this with who you follow right so you can follow different types of people it's like oh they also follow this oh that's cool we have that in common oh there's that great basically want to convey all those sides of your personality hitting on all the things that we talked about there before right so they really see this sample're like oh really cool。
