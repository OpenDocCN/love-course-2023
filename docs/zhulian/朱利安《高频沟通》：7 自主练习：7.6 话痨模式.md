# 朱利安《高频沟通》：7 自主练习：7.6 话痨模式

This one will also help。lowerer that far right， just good it enough because good enough。

 this will help and it' will also get you in a habit of just talking and talking and talking。

Heres the exercise。Nerse the two。One of you is curd。They're back the person doing the exercise。

The person who knew the exercise， they would be looking at the person in front of you， they back。

And for two minutes， we're going to time it。You're going to talk non。No feedback， no reaction。

 you talking to someone's back， you can also do this at home， just talking to a wall。

 just look at the wall and be like，h bh blah， like just non so topic you're the rule。

You can try and try whatever you want。You can tell stories， you can gr。

 it really doesn't matter content。ざさ。希翻场。No breaks。

 if you take more then a three to five second break is startup。

So you'll be facing someone's back and you'll literally say whatever's on your mind。

So I'm doing the demonstration of the exercise here。 And I don't really know what I'm saying。

 but I'm just gonna to riff。 And I'm gonna thinking about whatever's on my mind。

 And I'm thinking right now of a TV show。 And for some reason。

 the one that comes to mind is the vampire。 I'm going so fast。 you probably I'm like a rapper。

 And'm maybe fasterm and I'm a rap。 And that' what I'm saying。 I'm。 I'm just doing the example。

 And I still don't know what I'm， But I'm talking about whatever's on my mind。

 And I'm giving the demo but little like Nostop two minutes。 Now。

 you might not be able to do that fast。 And that's fine。 Do as fast as you can。😊。

For you to be able to do this， Gu what。 The words have to move faster then。That inner judgment。

For me to talk like that， I'm literally talking and after I talk I'm like， that's what I said。

 oh my God， that's what I said， yep， I guess that is。The words go first。Okay。

 so it has to be two minutes like that。Now， if you want to take this to the limit。

 say you do this every day， you wake up in the morning。

 so I'm looking at my toothrush I'm going to brush my teeth and here's what just the happen about。

Once you reach your peak speed， right to the point where it doesn't even make sense。

 like your mouth doesn't even follow。Then good。 See if you can do 5 minutes。

 See if you can do 10 minutes。 See if you can do 15 minutes。See if you can do 30。Do that。

 you'll never， ever run out of things to say。
