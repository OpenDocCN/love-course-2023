要不然的事，Zither Harp，It's going down， I'm yelling timber，You better move， you better dance。

Let's make a night， you won't remember，I'll be the one， you won't forget，Zither Harp。

The bigger they are， the harder they fall，These biggity boys and biggity dawg。

I have them like Miley Cyrus， close off，Trucking in their bras and thongs， timber，Face down。

 booty up， timber，That's the way we like to roll， timber，I'm sticking in her orange bills。

But I bet she will， timber，(音樂)。
