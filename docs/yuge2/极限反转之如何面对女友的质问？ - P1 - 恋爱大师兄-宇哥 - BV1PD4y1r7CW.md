要不然的事，Zither Harp，It's going down， I'm yelling timber，You better move， you better dance。

Let's make a night， you won't remember，I'll be the one， you won't forget，Zither Harp。

The bigger they are， the harder they fall，These biggity boys and biggity dogs。

I have them like Miley Cyrus， close off，Trucking in their bras and thongs，Timber， face down。

 booty up，Timber， that's the way we like the words。
