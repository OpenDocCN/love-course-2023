# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：1、社交焦虑大师班：6.外部工具

Get out of your head。Get into your body。How。😮，There are many ways， but the easiest way。

 and this is one that I still use to this day。Is the first thing that we do during the guided meditations。

 which is you take your awareness and you bring it down to the base of your spine。Just that no joke。

 just that like you're say you're out in the bound you're like， oh。

 I'm feeling anxious and you kind of feel that pull towards I'm only living in my head thinking and analyzing and micromanaging oh my god oh my god。

 oh my God， no， no， no， pause。Take all that， move it to the base of your spine I know it sounds cheesy。

 but it works， imagine your nose is down there， your ears are down there and just take a few deep breaths from the base of your spine。

One gets you out of your head。Really grounds you and anchors you in your body right if you're familiar with a lot of spiritual work。

 that would be like your root chakra just。Really anchors you just by taking a few deep breaths there。

It'll take a lot of the charge out of it doesn't get to the cause， but hey。

In the moment that happens。Do that。Do a lot of base of your spine breathing。The next one of course。

 is relax into it， like we said， change that label and eliminate all that resistance。Relax， embrace。

 feel it， don't try to battle it。Okay。Then。You can also ask yourself here what's the worst case scenario？

This is the big one right say it's like okay， I'm scared to say hi to this person because what if it doesn't go according to plan。

 what if I get rejected， what if they laugh at me， okay， what's the worst case scenario？Well。

 they might just say nice to meet you。Okay， that's the worst。

What amount of fear or anxiety should you feel around that right sometimes just asking yourself what's the worst case really takes the charge out of it。

Okay， also。If you have friends or you're going out and socializing with people。

 try to surround yourself with people who do take the charge out of things。Meaning。

Say it's you and your friend。And you get really triggered and there's a lot of anxiety you're like oh。

 everyone's staring at us， oh this is so scary。You can have two types of friends one someone who will add to the charge yeah you're right。

 it is so scary and this and that and and you both kind of like psy yourselves out。

Another type of friend is someone who's like oh it's not that bad look at this and they might show you again evidence of the contrary that pircces through that illusion that RAS hijack right or someone who's like worst case just this。

 just having people who just take the charge out of things helps tremendously even in life by the way。

 whenever you go through adversity or something or there's problems。

Two types of people you can share the news with and talk about it one is someone who's going to be like oh those problems are so bad did you also think of this and they get riled up and you get excited about the problems and they add to the charge and then another person is someone who's like look it's not that bad let's be realistic let's slow down someone who takes the charge out of it right a perfect example。

Not someone you'd want to。Model lifestyle wise， especially but but even emotionally right because and it's a fictional character but the character is a bit more so like。

😊，No， it's not good more like sociopathy and resistance。

 but if any of you ever watched the show Ozark。The Marty birdir character is a perfect example of someone who just takes the charge out of it right there might be a situation and you see someone else like panicking like the emotions take over like oh he's like well let's just logically look at the situation here's the worst case。

 take a deep breath like immediately takes the charge out。Start doing that to you。

 so do that to yourself and if you can also surround yourself with people who do that。In your life。

Okay accountability is big too on the external side I think that's a great training wheel to getting yourself to take action this is how I first was able to take action myself it was a few months of just like unable to like I said ask someone for the time and then what I did is I surrounded myself with other people who were working on their social skills that was the first step to me taking action and by going out with those people they were all taking action and I didn't want to be the only one who wasn't taking action。

😊，Right I wanted to gain acceptance from the group and I cared more about acceptance within that group than。

Whatever a stranger might think of me so what happens is you can say that the seesaw tip if it was just me out by myself。

 all I cared us about was people's reactions。But now I took another thing it's like actually this is scarier oh。

 now that's less scary so it made。The fear of what others thought of me less scary because I cared more of being accepted within the group。

Okay， so that's really what you want to do。You can surround yourself with people。For me。

 it really played on the validation side of things。

 but money does that as well funny enough just right now you by investing in yourself。

Through this course， through this coaching， there's some skin in the game。

 there is some accountability。Remind yourself of that， remind yourself， hey。

 everything that I'm learning here， this isn't YouTube。This isn't free， I paid for this。

Right you paid in terms of money you paid in terms of time investment right just watching the videos taking notes time investment being here on this call there's a lot of opportunity cost to go through this right every single minute you're spending towards this is a minute lost towards something else。

So you have some skin in the game， get your return， you have invested some。

 get a return on that investment， remind yourself of that， it's like， hey， if I don't take action。

 it's not like it just evens out whatever， then I'm losing。So remind yourself like， hey。

 here's the money。Now I better do it。Right that there creates that skin in the game you can also。

I mean， one thing I did for a while was I'd go out and give like 100 bucks to a friend and I'm like every time I say hi to someone。

 I want to say hi to 10 people， you give me 10 bucks back。And now it's like， oh。

 I want that money back。It's that whole philosophy of like throw your cap over the fence now you got to climb the fence。

All of you here with this program through your cap， climb the fence。Okay。

 this shouldn't be your your default for action， but it' a good training wheel。Highly recommend。Okay。

 and then what you'll notice here too is that the more action you take。

The less unknown there will be。And this is big。So with the unknown。

 you could think of that as the blank canvas upon which we project things。So if you think of。

For example， the future， right， a lot of it's unknown。

A lot of people are scared about the future because they project the past and their fears onto the future。

Right on the unknown and that's why they fear it if you think of it it's like。

There's nothing scary about the unknown because you don't know it。

We're just scared of the unknown because we project all those things onto it so the same here it's like if you haven't taken that much action in terms of socializing and meeting people there's a lot of unknown there's a lot of uncertainty there's a lot of having going to do this I have no idea what the outcome where the reaction is going to be and because there's all that unknown you're projecting all your fears onto it and it's really scary。

But。As you apply what we've been talking about here and you start taking action。

 you're going to start getting references and you're going to start seeing different patterns。

 you're going to start seeing different things to expect and a lot of it is going to be more known right you're like。

 hey I know that。You know， if I say this， I've gone pretty much every like once you talk to enough people。

 you will have gone pretty much every type of reaction。It will all be known。

 so there'll be nothing that's uncertain or unknown anymore and less of that canvas for you to project those fears upon。

Okay， the same is like the more you experience the world， the less you fear the world。

Crual the same as if you move to a new city at first you're like， oh， it's a new city。

 but then you live there a while， you get used to it， you no longer feel that。Okay。

 so eliminate the unknown by taking massive， massive action。
