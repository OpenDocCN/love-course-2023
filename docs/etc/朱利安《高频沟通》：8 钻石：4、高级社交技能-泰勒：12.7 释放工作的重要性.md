# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：4、高级社交技能-泰勒：12.7 释放工作的重要性

What are some things that we do， you know， to become more present to the moment。

 to become more internally expansive， spiritually expansive and so on and so forth。

 What are some things that we can do to work on that， including things you might learn for Julian。

 things that you might learn through transformation mastery。 What are some things there， yep。😊，Why。

 why are those things thought to be effective， Why do people report these things as being effective。

 What are some reasons that you guys can think about the top of your head。Mmm。Yeah。

 what does the meditation do as example？😡，Cuts off the thinking。

a realityIt directs your attention from your thoughts。

yous happening around Yeah because what it does is that when you're not actively trying to think and then your brain's doing it anyway。

 you're like， wait a second， that's just what my brain's doing that wasn't me all and then you start to see what it is that your brain is doing and then you're creating that center point of proactivity。

😡，So that's what meditation does。 Re work。 What that's meant to do。

 the way that I think about release work。 everyone's gonna to have their own take。

 let's give you my take。 Okay， you could have your own take。

 My take is that if when you're traumatized， your mind tend to loop on it to try to resolve it。

 So release work is meant to bring that trauma into resolution is the way that I think about it。

 So funny enough。 I see people that have such incredible results with release work。

 It's funny how that works， right You'll laugh at this。

 I've probably done over probably 3 to 500000 in personal coaching on release work。

Does that surprised you guys。 Okay， and yet， I've never had a super duper powerful release。

Let let's think how funny that is。 Okay， so I've done releases with people and they haven't because I know how to do release work as is Julian。

 and I've seen incredibly powerful releases。 I have never had in3 to 500000 in personal coaching that I've gotten in people to help me with release work。

 I've never had a release as powerful as usually the ones that I've seen the classes that I go to So if I never had to release that powerful。

 why do I still continue to do it。😡，mulative。 I just think it's cumulative。 Yeah， I yeah。

 I don't need like the fact that someone's able to have a hyperpower release like that。 I'm jealous。

 That's amazing。 I'm not able to do that。 but what I found was value in the process。

 And that was why I kept doing it。 I realized that my mind is that I'm I'm always getting triggered and traumatized all the time。

 And so I hit a point where I built some wealth。 And I'm like， I built some money。

 I'm not any happier at all。 I feel literally the same。 In fact。

 I'm more miserable than ever building something because it's always freaking plate spinning that have to monitor all the time。

 And problems coming up and all this crap。 And so I'm seeing this。 And I'm just like。

 the moneys not even helping me。 I feel the exact same。You know。

Because you always thought you're like， wait， you're like I'm going to reach this point where all my dumpster in a row。

Quack qua' all the ducks in a row。 And then I'm gonna be happy。 And it never freak it happens。

 And you realize that was complete fantasy。 It never will happen。 And then that's when you're like。

 maybe I need to do some inner work。 that's when you see that。

 So inner work is also very good for when you' to peak potential because it winds up happening is that you realize。

 okay， I'm actually taking on a greater burden of stress from my entrepreneurial endeavors or for my accomplishments。

 And I'm working on whatever the case。 And therefore I need a release work。

 So I did a lot of release work to bring these things like these things are just like this guy did this。

 This guy did this and I'm like he's stupid so bad that happened。 I'm just like， no。

 I've got to bring this to resolution。 So I never had a super big release where a ton of tears are pouring out and things like that。

 I'm jealous of you you could do that。 But what I found was just the mere act of doing that and bringing it to resolution daily train my mind on the process of bringing these problems into resolution。

Now， what did that do for me between meditation and release work？

 What did that do for me internally or spiritually， What does that do。出行。Yeah。

 what it does is it gets you into a place of productivity because your psyche。

 your proactive consciousness is not always being put into reaction because most of us are always counterping all day。

 We're spending the whole freaking day counter punching like this app we're just doing this all the time。

 that's my invitation So how I feel。 So so it's just this whole day and the really big thing that you're gonna start to realize you get older too。

 I'm telling you most of the real value in life comes from actually like sitting down and focusing for a period of time。
