# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.4 传达你的价值

When it comes to communicating your value， this is something that is primarily subcomated。Huge。

 it just happens unconsciously beneath the surface。 We're always pinging for value。

 It's not something you have to overtly say or do。Okay。

 it's subcomated through behavioral cues and how people or the environment reacts to you。

 those two things。For example。See me coming up here on stage。If I come up here， I'm very at ease。

 I'm loud。 feel comfortable being loud， taking up。You could say space emotionally， verbally。

 physically。What does that subcomicate。This person probably had a lot of positive references in the past。

Probably used to be in this position of authority， feels very comfortable。

 even with the social pressure， et cetera， et cetera， valuable。I don't have to say it。

 I'm going to be like， hey everyone， I've done a lot of seminars， you know， and it's like。

 if I show up and I'm like that， it's like okay。Subcomated。Also， subcomic on how people react to you。

 if you're talking to someone， like， you don't even have to be talking that much。 Like。

 say it's a group of three people and we're all talking and say you just kind of look at the outside。

And I would say somewhere to ask you， who's the most valuable person？Say I am。Or me。

But in this situation， let's just say I'm not even talking that much， like they're talking a lot。

 but in the way that they react to me， you'll notice that if I even say one word。

 this is a hypothetical， they might just immediately shut up。 So say they're like， oh。

 I this thing in this movie and I'm like， oh I't know about that， they're like。

 and they both turn to me real fast。Unconsciously， remember， follow the magnet effect。 Oh， wow。

 this person is dictating here。 He He might not even say much， but immediately， they react。

Where if how much their talking states it's to impress， you also notice those subtleties。

So this is also good practice whenever you're out there， it's like， hey。

 who's reacting more to the other person？Key quote。

 and any social interaction there's always one person reacting more to the other person than that person's reacting to them。

 so you always want to analyze your behavior and microbehaor。

 not not in the moment because that'll get you in your head， but just ask yourself。

 what does this communicate。me going up and say， here's an example。

 if you go up to someone to say hi and you're very hesitant。

 what does that subcommunicate that you probably got some battery actions in the past。

 you probably got quote unquote rejected in the past and your value is low。Otherwise。

 why would you go up so timidly？Only someone， excuse me， hi， only someone that timid。

 the only reason they would be that timid is they got bad reactions in the past， low value。

If you're an awesome person， you should act as if you never got rejected before。

 how would you act as if you never got rejected before， Hey， how's it going loud？That there， oh。

 loud， expressive， subcomates a lot of value， but also subcommates， you're comfortable。

Dealing with social pressure， having eyes on you， it also means in the past。

 having eyes on you probably meant that people looked up to you and nothing bad happened。

 or you would not dare do that if in the past， you were loud and people beat you up or shamed you。😡。

You'd be quiet now today。So it's little things like that， oh in behavior。

 what does it communicate and it's behavioral cues within yourself and your way of talking。

 your way of communicating same with holding eye contact so on and so forth， being open。

 comfortable being open， right people are afraid to hold eye contact。

A big reason is it's that cheesy， but yet true saying， you know。

 the eyes are the windows into someone's soul is that people will sense looking at you in the eyes how congruent you are。

The hardest place to quote unqu fake it is in the eyes if you're not confident。

People will see it mainly by looking at you in the eyes so that's why if you're just like hey and youre are able to and you're just it's a sign of openness and just like yep what you see is what you get not hiding anything massive value Okay so on your end。

But also in how people react to you as a rule here， be at the cause。

Not the effect who is leading the interaction， leading the vibe， leading the pace。

 and who is reacting more than they are leading。Who is？You know。

 shifting how they talk to to please the other person versus the other way around。

 you can still sprinkle in verbal cues， things like disqualification。

 what does this communicate value it communicates that you aren't chasing them。

Right reacting also plays into chasing。Um， and it sets a frame where it's like you're proactively not chasing right it's like。

 oh nice， you know， we'd never get along。To that view on like， you know what， we never get a one。

Wait what， why？Or oh， I suck。Wait， what it's like no one who's chasing or trying to impress would say I suck。

So something like that or you being so comfortable saying that and just really not even caring you're like。

 oh yeah， you know what， I don't care so much that I'll even disse myself。

But then it's also very different like you could say that also people will say over the top try hard so it's always the place it's coming from。

 but that is something that communicates value in the verbal cues。Getting people to brag for you。

 that's key。
