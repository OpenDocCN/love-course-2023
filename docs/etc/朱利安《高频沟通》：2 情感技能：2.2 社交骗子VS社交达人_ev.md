# 朱利安《高频沟通》：2 情感技能：2.2 社交骗子VS社交达人_ev

The way most people approach this in terms of the emotional skills or how confident they feel。Is。

They feel at a core like they're down here。And they want to be up here。Right， now。

 the most toxic form。Is people try to bring others down to their level。

 right if I just make them doubt themselves， question their self esteem。

 then they'll be at the bottom like me and that's terrible。But what having and doing really does is。

You still assume that you're not confident， you still assume you're not good enough and you rely on having or doing to get you up here。

But here's the catch。 It doesn't matter how much you have or do。

You're never going to change the original assumption that you're down here to begin with。

If you feel like that， when you go out and socialize， when you want to meet someone。

 if you feel like it's this build up to， right， It's me down here。 And I got to build myself up。

I got to build momentum。 I got to take action。 I got to use these awesome lines and stuff to compensate。

 to come off as something better than I am。😊，You will forever feel like you're down here。

K saying from yours， truly， it's only someone who isn't confident， who works on being confident。

And once more， you keep giving your power way to what you're doing， what you're having， never you。

The approach here is， why do I need these things to be up here？

Why am I not just up there to begin with。Work on this directly。

 And this will actually not come from this act of trying to build up to or become。

It will come down to letting go。Where you identify what's telling you you're down here。

 And we're going to be talking about this。 You let go of all the lies， all the conditioning。

And you start with the being。And understanding this。

 what you realize is that when it comes to the emotional skills， those 80%。

 it comes down to letting go。Letting go is the foundation of socializing。That's how you get there。

If you focus on the having or the doing， trying to get there， using that as crutches。

 all that you will become is a social scammer。It's harsh to hear， but it's true。

You're trying to portray yourself， you're trying to be something， someone that you're not。

I don't feel good enough。 How can I be more confident。

 How can I look more confident if I rely on momentum， Maybe they'll see me differently。

That's scaming。Why are you not like that to begin with。Okay， and you can also audit this here， where。

There are two， you could say， games that are being played。 A lot of people operate from the outward。

 inward game。 It's all about what out there。 That's what dictates how I feel in here。That's why， hey。

 if I gather positive references， yeahy， I feel good。That's one game。 The other game is inside out。

Work on the inner。 You work on the being that bleeds into the doing， which bleeds into the having。

 the social scammer tries to have and do in order to work on the being。The social master。

Works on the being and lets that affect the having and doing and color。

 everything that comes from that。Here are some tells。If you're a social scammer。Number one。

It comes down to faking the being and putting on a certain front。

If there is a fear of people seeing through you。You're scaming。Okay， and this will。

 the way you'll experience it will come down to you， you know， putting like it's a lot of effort。

 right， you can audit when you're talking to someone and say the interaction ends。

 Do you leave feeling energized and relaxed and feeling good。 Or is it now it can finally be me。 Oh。

 that was a lot of effort。 I think I did it right， I think I put on the right front。 Oh。

 I think it was good。😊，Then you're scanning。Okay， and it will come down to again。

 you have this front。Usually rely on people to validate the front。 You're like， do you like me。

 Do you like it， Do you like it， relying on validation， while at the same time。

 fearing that they'll see through it。The way this will also manifest in interactions is people will have a lot shorter interactions。

 You might have this where you're talking to someone and say it's going well。 And for some reason。

 you just leave。And there's that fear where， hey， if I stay a little bit longer。

 they're either going to see through this or they're going to see that I'm not as cool as they might think I am after these five minutes。

 I can't maintain this coolness。That's scam。Overcompensating。

If you also feel your confidence shift depending on what situations you find yourself in。

Depending on how you look。That there。Is it tell you're in that having doing social scammer paradigm。

And we'll talk about this。 but the social scammer， your level of confidence is always fluctuating because it's situational。

Right， it's I'm confident because I have this。 I'm confident because I'm doing this。

 corere confidence is， I'm confident why just cus。And that's also why。This approach here。

Doesn't work。Because you'll never have that core confidence。 It always depends on something。

Right now， does this mean。You know， never， for example， play on things like having social alliances。

 right， Like if you go out with a lot of friends， you're gonna feel much more confidence。 No。

 you can use that as a small percent every now and then， right。

 Like no one just to be clear and realistic has 100% core confidence all the time。 That's a myth。

 No one。 But everyone can achieve a point where that is your default。 That's the majority。

 And then every now and then you can sprinkle in a little bit of situational confidence because why not？

 But that's not the foundation， For most people， it's the opposite。 for most people。

 they rely on the situational confidence。 they try to spike their state。That's all momentum is， too。

 if I get enough good reactions， I feel good。😊，Oh， if I do this thing， if I say this thing。

 I feel good。 If I look this way， I feel good。 If my friends are here， I feel good。😊，Versus。

 are you spik in it or is that the default。ok。Button pushing。

 that's also a symptom of the social scammer。Where you know that if you depend on say good reactions。

 you might go to someone and say， I know that if I say something along this format。

 I'll get a good reaction。 I know that if I share this story， I'll get a good reaction。

 So you start button pushing。 like push push， push， get feed me good reaction， yes。Scamer。

It's unnatural， it comes off， as very forced。Right， you'll see， by the way。

 social scammers who are on the more like kind of shy side。

 but also even if they do come off as confidence， it's very overcompensating。Right， it's like。

 something's a little bit off， right， Like they might come up and be like， just over the top。 Hey。

 how's it going。 Yeah， like trying to be confident and be like。

 something's a little off for always trying to， for example， brag or name drop or it's like。

 just always playing this competitive game。 That's the scammer。😊，And this， by the way。

 will kill it like it will destroy any kind of results when it comes to viing and connecting with someone。

 especially when you start connecting with people who are at a higher level。Okay。

 I've seen this a lot in the business world。 example that comes to mind is I was out with some friends。

And this other friend of a friend shows up。 and he has a very successful business。

 actually here in L A。 and he showed up and。😊，Within that group， the people who are there。

 he felt a little。Below， right， he felt， all these people are pretty successful。

 I got to impress them and he didn't realize that everyone was there just joking around。

 just having a good time。 So he came into it instead of from this collaborative。

 We're all joking around to here we go， Go into war。

 let's prove ourselves and just trying to name drop like how much money he made。

 how his year was going。 His month was going and this and this。 And everyone's like， cool， dude。

 But let's let's joke。 He's like， no no， But you hear about this。 And it was just very weird。

 killed it。 No one wanted to see him again。😊，Okay， that there， social scammer。

Micromanaging everything， overthinking， second guessing， it comes off as very reactive。

You're stuck in your head。Even when things may go well， you're still in your head。

 because if I let go of the control， everything will be terrible。 They'll see the real me。

It's very competitive as we talked about， and the results you get is only temporary。Which。

 by the way， another thing。People in the doing paradigm rely on our social anxiety challenges and the high that they get after completing one。

RightYou might have experienced this where， say you're like， oh， you know。

 same with building momentum。 right， I'm kind of scared to talk to people。

 say you talk to someone and it goes well， You actually experience a high。 You're like yes。

 and then people rely on that。That's terrible。 Social anxiety challenges are great。

If you use them coupled with letting go， but if you use them just trying to get high off of them。

 that is a terrible approach。O， so that there' is the social scammer。 The social master。

 here's the difference。Very relaxed。Right。There's another classic saying ego equals effort。

 the more effort there is in your interactions。The more you're trying to scam。The more effortless。

The more authentic you are。So it's relaxed， it's fun。

 You feel comfortable putting yourself out there。😊，State is the default。

You don't need to spike it up。Just who you are。It's not a buildup。Same with an event like this。

 I don't come at an event like this。 Like， here we go going to war and trying to blast through。 It's。

 yeah， I'm going to be loud。 I'm gonna put myself out there。

 but it's more me sinking into myself and just unleashing it。Okay， and you must all realize this。

 too， when it comes to confidence or even charisma， you all already have it。

It's not this thing that you need to fake and build。 You were born。

You could say is this as cheesy as it sounds， right。

 like this ball of infinite energy of expansiveness of light， you name it。

 and things happened during your upbringing that stifled you。But even today。

 you all have that one environment where you do feel confident。It could be around close friends。

 family members could even be just alone。 It could be playing a video game with the headset。

 You'll see people who are extremely shy in real life on the headset just yaapp and about super confidence。

 We all have that one instance。It's probably not the majority of your life。

 but you have that one instance。So what does that tell you， all those things like being witty。

 being a natural， you have access to it。But what we do is we tell ourselves， we don't。

 They don't have access to that。 And then we try to recreate it。

There's a lot of ties to spirituality， by the way， when it comes to social skills。

That's the whole spiritual main approach is， you know， instead of being the all， right。

 the universe being， you name it， we create this ego and we are like。

 I'm the separate thing and then we try to find the infinite through the separate thing。

 same as social skills。Instead of being expressive， that's naturally social confident。

 You tell yourself you aren't。 and then you try to recreate that。 That's why it never works。

It's not about becoming。 It's about realizing。 It's about letting go of all this things。

 all the beliefs， the conditioning。You name it that's blocking that from coming out in all situations。

 And you can just imagine what if you had access to。That personality， that state。

 the real you in that moment where you feel completely comfortable。

 What if you had access that all the time。That there gets you 80% of the way。Then of course。

 you can perfect it and tweak it。 That's the last 20%， but the 80% is that。Reach that point。Okay。

 you feel natural。Non reactive。You're indifferent to approval and disapproval。

That's another good audit， when you receive approvals， you feel enhanced， when you get disapprovled。

 you feel diminished。You're comfortable in all environments。😡，You're outside your head。

You're in a very collaborative state。Instead of me versuss， it's all on the same team。

And the result is permanent。It's not something that you lose。 And if you have that fear， like， oh。

 I had that glimpse， but I lost it， but I lost it， then that's not the results you're after。

That was a result of a social scammer， not a social master。
