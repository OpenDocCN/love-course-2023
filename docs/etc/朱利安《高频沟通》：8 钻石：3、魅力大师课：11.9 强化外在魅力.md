# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：3、魅力大师课：11.9 强化外在魅力

Now when it comes to superchar the outer side of charisma， what I wrote down here， okay。

 this is something my friend Jeff talks about in charisma mastery， this is。My take on it。

 he writes down there's concentrating， energizing， structuring， stylizing。

 imagining and coordinating。Okay， and this here is really once you have that foundation， okay。

 the caricature of me right all the stuff I'm into okaym creative here there's。

Different ways that you can mold the expression of your authenticity authenticity and the vibe and authenticity of the topics right so say。

You know， we take that example of。U， someoneone asks me say for my age， I'm like， oh yeah。

 I'm 46 daughter just 21 okay， that there。If it makes me authentically laugh again has to be built on authenticity。

 that's the foundation。Has to be done for you if you're doing it to make others laugh and it's again little dancing monkey。

 it has to be you entertaining yourself， not others。

 and law of state transfers it transfers onto others。

But assuming all that's done in terms of superchar it。

 there's a million ways I can add texture to this。For example， I could say， oh yeah， I'm 46。

 my first time out。My daughter is at the Bars her 21st birthday。I could also say， oh yeah。I'm'm 46。

 you know， first time out， my daughter's at the barge just getting trashed。

 she's just totally wasted。Right bit of a different tonality。

 different words used different picture painted。Same idea， explained very differently。Right。

 you could even say。Take a concept， right， like hey， you know what？嗯。

Instead of say feeling sorry for yourself， one little shift you can do is ask yourself。

 what are you going to do about it？Very basic say selfhel concept instead of feeling sorry for yourself step it up there's one way of putting it you could textize in many ways right you can be like hey。

 instead of being a fucking little bitch step it up what are you going do about it you pathetic right like something off the top like just that you're like who like same idea same exact concept。

A very different flavor。Right so this will require one concentrating what does this mean it means as we talked about in the course here forward willpower。

 this is why the inner work， the emotional skills is so key you got to free up all that mental bandwidth to really be able to lock in right to really be able to concentrate and be aware of all the dynamics of how to textize that expression that authentic expression of self so concentration。

From there energizing it right， expanding your range of expressiveness。

 you could say something like hey， you should take responsibility， do something about it。

Sitting in the corner crying it's not going to do much good just very flat right like hey。

 do something about it， you know， you can stay in the corner crying if you want or step it up。

I had more of a range， the same with speaking with your body， speak fast， slow， you know， loud。

 quiet。Commanding， challenging， adding to the fun， like switch it up there， they spice it up。

And you can play around at that right structuring this is also very important there's many ways you can say a certain story or share a certain point or make a certain joke where if you look at the content itself here。

 Okay so concentrating energizing the vibe content itself。

 how are you going to put the pieces of content in a certain order。

To get the the most impact right if I'm explaining a concept。

 it's like sometimes I have to explain this part first for you to then get this part and then I need to say that part before this part for you to even get that part right so there's a certain sequence with your story you can ask yourself here well。

 what's the best way and funniest way to tell this story What if I lead with this What if I put that bit before this What about that part before there。

Be very aware of it， Okay， but taking it even deeper one thing that really。You know。

 draws people attention and it is multiple threading。Right instead of just being very linear。

 this is what our mind does right we tend to be very logical like story one， story two， story three。

 story four， what about having all four stories going on at the same time？

Right so you might think say with the the thing the age， I was like， how old are you I'm like， oh。

 46， you know， my daughter just turned 21 she's at the bar。

Guess what I'm not going to be like and then I finish the bar story and then i'm going to the next story。

 I'll actually have multiple stories going so might'd be like oh yeah i'm46 my daughter's at the bar anyway。

Is it your first time here， by the way？No， I've been here before huh。

Would have thought differently so anyway my daughter now there's two stories going on I just opened up another story。

 then you can open up another story and open up another story and open up another story more stories going on simultaneously multiple threads。

😡，Really captivates people right this is what's。Marvel does if you take infinity war and end game。

It's just all multiple threading there's all these storylines where the heroes are in different parts。

 different planets and it's like you see a little bit of one， then you jump to the other one。

 then you come back then you jump to the other one， et cea， et cetera。

 especially nowadays how ADD people are it keeps our attention hook it's like oh you see Spiderman and then after a while you're like okay kind of used to scene Spiderman now cut scenes and you see Captain America you're like oh Captain America new stimulus oh new story back to Iron Man it's like movies have essentially like that they've essentially become a bunch of different Tiktok videos。

You're just shifting in between every 15 seconds to keep your attention there do that with the story right instead of point a point B point C Tiktk get up80D tiktok multiple thread jump randomly and this will that unpredictability really spices things up in the structuring of what it is that you're talking about seeing things that are out of left field。

😊，Right， you know， for example， like okay here here's a great example。

 but let's go back to okay me for example like someone's like okayy。

 how old are you like 46 you know my daughter's 21 at the bar now just here what did I do same thing right I was like now let me tell you this thing back to the daughter even in the explanation I'm doing here it is multiple threads。

😊，Practice this use it okay again， this is where you sprinkle on top though it's supercharging the outer。

 it can't be your fo stylizing it。😡，Your choice of words， your verbal style。

 whether you swear or not， for example， like all of that adds the style to it so you have concentrating energy structure style。

Right play around with that you'll see， for example。

 like what's the verbal styles we talked about at Jordan Peterson， how does he talk。

 what's the verbal style with this person， what's my verbal style， what's Owen's verbal style。

Get a feel for it， what's your verbal style？again， you can say the same thing using different words。

Different you can paint very different picked like pictures too。

 and that leads the next one like imagining right like make it graphic like I screw what's the person picturing in their mind right if I'm if I do that joke。

 it's like， yeah， my Dars 21。Right， let's just say， let's just say here's the facts I'm 46。

 my daughter 21。 she's drinking。 and let's just say。

She's been bringing people home and we're sharing a hotel and that's the craziness and that's like hi just kidding。

You could say that in so many ways you'd be like， yeah， you know， she's just u， like for example。

 like she's 21， you know， she's at the bar， total fucking slut。

Now there's an example like same story， imagine you said everyone's like。

 did he just say I was my fucking daughter with the fuck right。

 it's like it's super like total slut takes it after my ex wifefe fucking horror。Now what I do there。

 just the swearing， the tonality， it just adds a graphic it just paints this crazy as fucking picture。

Right and then it could be yeah you know brings home people every day and then you know you could even paint the picture too instead of like i'm in there in the hotel room and they're having sex and you know I just learned to accept it you could also exaggerate and then this thing and then at one point the thing flew on me like you can paint this whole picture right that there is supercharging the outer right you can say it in many different ways the same with。

😊，I do this a lot even in content， right？Explaining a point I could link it to a certain story like here I chose to link it to that crazy story for this idea I could have linked it to another story this is really yeah the texturizing stuff you want to get a feel for right so make a graphic and then of course coordinating which goes hang out concentrating putting all this together and being aware of all of it at the same time right because then you're be like what about the structure and multiple threads and now you're in your head？

This is once more why emotional skills has to be the key， okay， but this here。

Is good is so this isn't something that you know I used to do and now I don't do right someone' was like oh you know or Julia in his back like no this is my humor it was then it still is to this day right but then there's different shades of it too so。

You know， I've had the same types of jokes I made with spirituality， right one that I brought in。

 for example， was。There's this story it's a true story in Washington state and it's one my friend derek used to say all the time and I brought it in when it comes to spirituality this story of。

You know this guy in Washington State called Mr。 Hans and you can Google this it's a true story and this guy this weird fetish where he liked to get fucked by animals right like horses and bulls and stuff I never looked in details i'm paraphrasing but anyways he loves to get fucked。

And what he likes better than getting fucked by bulls and horses is to not do it alone。

 so he found some people online like 10 to 12 people and they would go up to。

Washington State some farm and they'd all get fucked by horses and bulls right and then one day he got fucked a little too hard and they had to drive in the hospital and they just dropped him off on the curve because they didn't want to get caught for getting fucked by animals and there was internal bleeding and he died and that's how people found out about the story so。

😊，That's the story now this story here say'm doing a seminar bit I can stretch it to make it so graphic and add although it's dark humor it's like I can add jokes and stuff in it and the whole audience is like oh what at all and it's like and again it's like where is he going with this way what and then I would simply tie it into which is a great point to self acceptancecept and self love。

a lot of people， they and everyone's like， wait what， it's like。

 think about it right a lot of people。Can't truly like they don't truly believe that someone can like them for them right it's like no one likes me for me。

 I'm not good enough， et cetera， et cetera。Well here's the thing， right。

 if this fucking guy can find 10 to 12 people to get fucked by horses and bulls。

Are you telling me you can't find someone who will like you for you like say the universe gave you a challenge in life right now it's like option one find someone who likes you for you option two go find people to get fucked by animals right。

😊，Guess what probability is you it'll probably be a lot easier to find someone who likes you for you no matter who you are so so that's that's the gist of it and then you probably can see some clips where I say it online it's like there's so many ways of just then articulating this so same type of humor linkedIn with a really deep concept that links to self help self love and spirituality。

Same thing right so it's not this thing which's like it's either this or that it's like you link it to whatever you're always just creative and I also want to say too when it comes to energy。

😊，Is another key point。Being charismatic doesn't mean necessarily being high energy right you'll see people are very high energy。

 but you also see charismatic people who aren't right again。

 look up a lot of celebrities you'll see some celebrities they do interviews and they're just。😊。

A lot more quiet right or even old school like Marlon Brando right like it's a lot。

Less high energy but you just something about it again that's really the foundation of authenticity authenticity on a more macro level in terms of you and your personality and authenticity on a more micro level in terms of just how you feel in the moment。

Right there's some events where I don't feel as high energy sometimes when I go out I don't feel high energy。

 I don't try to fake it， I play into it， but the same principles then apply。😡，What's low energy fund。

 what's low energy carefr， what's low energy passion？so always play on authenticity。😊，啊。But yes。

 it's like。You know。This is just who you are and you can even this is the last key point here is you can trace it back to your childhood like。

TheThe examples I gave here of the whole boat type of humor I had that as far as I can remember right Another thing I would say is like a lot of what would you do if right I would do that as a kid like mom。

 what would you do if aliens landed in backyard here's like what would you do this What do you do if that that's that's my type of humor so you can find a lot of traces of like the。

The source of material you could save your charisma in your past， so introspection is key as well。
