# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：3、魅力大师课：11.8 从脱口秀中学习

So much value as well in stand comedy right this for me personally is something that this is pre。

CoVID lockdowns and stuff right？It was such a thing as LA being amazing。

 I would go to comedy shows at least once a week。Right that was just something I have a huge passion for I absolutely love its one of my favorite things to do right favorite activities hobbies going to comedy shows and LA had the best lineups and you would just see there too right like you're going up in front of is a comic in front of crowd。

😊，A lot of people sometimes don't even know you how can you captivate their attention right so it's of course on humor you can see also the way they structure the jokes。

 especially seeing it in person and this is what's so beautiful about going in person versus say through a movie or on Netflix or whatnot is you just there's no barrier between you and like the vibe right so you pick up on it you can see the times where they crush it you can see the times where they bomb and don't crush it I've seen for example d cook。

Um， who I liked when I was many years ago when I was younger， I really liked。

Then I would see him live a lot and he's like H and he just wasn't good at all。 I was like man。

 this guy fell off。 And then one time he did a show and he bombed for most people but for me that was one of the best comedy shows I've ever seen He just went so off brand extreme trying out new material and it was the type of like just shocking material like the whole room was just like right so so again just seen the behind the scenes of stuff like if you can go in person I'd highly suggested if you can't go on YouTube go on Netflix watch some of the shows but this year is key in terms of charisma and especially learning how to hit the fun button right So again I wrote down like Dan Cook that was one of the more earlier influences for me。

And the big thing value wise I got from that was。Really what I said before right speaking with your entire body like he's really good at putting his whole body into the act or with the stories that he tells he'll like。

 you know， be the person who kneels down and he has these。

Distinctive Danme cook type moves and stances and poses that are a little weird but cannot not be exaggerated but also really congruent and on brand with him so you can kind of see like oh there's there's someone once more turned into a caricature of themselves right so that's the main thing I got from him is like kind of talking with your body。

Russell Brand was one where it was like， hey， talking with your body from Dan Cook with Russell Brand similar to how we talked about with say Jordan Peterson。

 he just has a really good way of articulating a very smart way of articulating。Different ideas。

 right， and also mixing in。Humor with education right like his comedy shows aren't just like。

Skits and stuff there's actually lessons life lessons。

 even sometimes even deeper in spiritual lessons， especially nowadays mixed in with that humor so that was the big thing I from there Jim Jeffreries。

Like those top three aren't per se my favorite， but they are the ones earlier on that had the most influence Jim Jeffs had a ton of influence when it comes to it sounds funny to say swearing and getting your swearing timing down and using swear words as a way to。

Add more graphic and punch and juice to what it is that you're saying。And then。

Yeah that and then also kind of like leaning into the edge of a bit of shock humor so those three。

Again， hold a special place in my heart and then I list out the others that I really love here like all of these 10 out of 10 right like。

Luis CK， obviously Dave Chappelle， Christstalia， Andrew Sanino， amazing。

 I saw some of his shows before he started blowing up like with this podcast and you've seen some TV shows too crushed it。

Mickey Glaazer Tony Rock right that's actually Chris Rock's brother and I've there was one show he did where it was a charity show。

And。This is actually a funny show it's a charity show。

Around Christmas time in LA and you had to buy your ticket and bring a gift that they would then give to kids right like I think orphans or why not like an orphanage and it was like he went there and the whole time is like okay well who's in charge of this charity and it was of course like the typical kind of like corporate CEO and the CEO table and his whole set was improv in the moment just trashing the guy who set it up for some reasons like just like he's doing it just for the brand is for his business not really shit like it was just really funny just one of the best I've seen I was like wow so that was 10 out of 10 and then actually Harlan Williams。

His stuff online is not that good to be fair， but in person， he might be。

Like in my top three for sure so he was at actually the same show and he comes up it was a really weird show and he comes up and just bombs like it was one of the worst sets where he's like what is all this and he picks up all the toys he's like this is cute right all these these kids are gonna get the toys except for one and just smashes the toy and I think he was trying to do it as a joke but the toy just shattered he's like one kids not going to have a toy no one laughed I chuggled no one else laughed but anyway his whole set then was also and this is what I love about is improv the moment has a very unique type of humor and vocabulary。

And。He improvised this crazy made up story。Based upon even himself。

 he gave himself a fake name out there he's like I'm this guy like playing this role and the whole story was like。

Building on jokes the prior comics had done in the sets prior so he listened to all their acts and just spun this off the it was just he just really is amazing right Bobby Lee。

 Eric Griffin， Theovanughn， Nicole Byer， Mark Marron， Eliza Schlessinger， Tim Dylllan。

 Jeff Ross and Brennan， Anthony Jessenniick， Winnie Cummings。

 Jamie Kennedy Bill B Run there's a million right but like all of these that I wrote down here。

 10 out of 10 if you can see him in person， so much value from that。
