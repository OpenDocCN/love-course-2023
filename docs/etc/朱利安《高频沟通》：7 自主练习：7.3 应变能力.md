# 朱利安《高频沟通》：7 自主练习：7.3 应变能力

This one's a fun one。 What I want you to do is to take a pen。Here's a ton。

 make sure you have one pen per group。げます。There's a bunch on the table。

If anyone wants the special blessed pen， you may have this one， I will。There you go， Oh。

 there he goes。Now this one here， you're going to be facing each other again。

This is a great exercise。Number one for improv， but number two。

 to get you to just roll with the punches。People get stifled so fast whenever they're talking to someone。

 they're hooked on that control muscle。 Things must go a certain way。

 We're talking about something it must go in this direction。 If I say this。

 people should react this way and it's like heavy and they're again so attached to the outcome。

Getting to the cause， of course， is letting go。 But this can really help with the whole role with the punches side of things。

 So here's what you're to do。 It's going to be a bit of a role play。

And you're going to go for about 30 seconds or so each。The person。Who holds the pen。Is ultimately。

The CEO， the inventor of this pen。The person talking to you is a famous journalist。

Who's interviewing you about？This specific pen。Now， this is a great one。

The journalist interviewing you is going to ask you whatever you can ask literary， whatever。

 You can make up questions， whatever。Your job is to throw kind of curveballs to this inventor CEO。

And the CEO， you can never say no， you can never disagree。

 All you can do is yes and agree and roll with the punches。 So， for example， Sam'm doing it with you。

 You're the inventor of this pen。 You ready， yes。So real quick， give me the rules again。

You invented it。 I'm interviewing you。 You can never disagree with what I say。

 You can only build upon what I say。So tell us how you came up with this pen。Well。

It says King transmission company on it。I think you're confusing it with the previous model。

 this specific one。Well， it's got an extra little ball on the top that is extra squishy。

 but tell us about this story， something do with a forest， I believe。Yes， actually。

 the forest is made out of trees that are green， but I like the color blue Can you tell us about the Z factor？

Yeah， the Z factor。 It comes comes after the Y factor。 That's the B factor。 I'm talking about the Z2。

Yes。The Z next to planetet B。 Nope， no， that's the wrong one。

 I believe that's the previous model again， the Z2 with that one。Yes。

 you talked about in many other interviews。 if you could expand upon that for the viewers， please。

Yeah， honestly， it's whatever you would like it to be。や。

I feel like that's deflecting the answer a little bit you talked about in the last interview something with your exwife。

 I understand I don't want to provide you the answers。

 I want you to provide the answers for yourself。 And that is what that sounds like a lot of disagreement。

 I want to hear more yes answer。All right then。Tell us about the B， Y X symptom。 The B， Y X symptom。

 Yeah， interestingest。 that is actually the disease that this pen actually wrote down for the first time。

You said Elon Musk was a big part of this Oh yeah， definitely definitely。Can you elaborate， please？

He actually signed his contract before he's actually shooting out to Mars。

 this is the pen that he used give him a hand， come on。是这样。With this here， notice。

The job is the interviewers to throw like random questions。 again。

 it doesn't matter what you say you can make up words。 you're just throwing all these curveballs。

 and as the person receiving the question， your job is remain grounded。

 nothing should shove you in your head or make you be like， I guess like nothing It's just like。

 oh yeah， of course， of course， as if it's just part of the plan。Can you roll with chaos。

 Can you remain grounded with chaos， Can you roll with the punches。

 or is that control muscle running you， Okay， I know I did it to you。

 You can do it to me if you want。 I invented this Ben。 What do you want to ask me about it。

 All right。Interesting pen。 It's got an interesting shape to it。 You want to tell me about it。

 modeled it after a part of my body。Interesting。Is it a part that maybe you are missing that most men have？

If you have to ask， it's after my father's， mine doesn't live up to it。

 but he was always a big inspiration for me。Big， big inspiration。wow， I know。 that's what I thought。

 You're actually really inspiring me right now。 Tell me a little bit more What is it called。Sharpie。

 Sharpie， wow， elaborate for me， why is it called Sharie？His was always a little sharp。

He told me about when he was younger， and I I was a little poer than the rest。

And showers growing up show me how it feels？Yeah。Sometimes I do。 But I mean， sure。Yes。That's the tip。

Oh wow， right on。Yeah。😊，然。Where。Yeah， was it a gift for your mom？It was， but she wasn't a fan of the。

Be up。Foppadu symptom。Button right， right， so tell me a little bit more about the Zin Muu。

Aspect of it， the Zimmunu aspect。That was when I first started working on when I was five before the accident。

い。I know you're making me recall a lot of sad moments。Zimuu。Is what gave me hope in the darkness。

 right， that accident that actually lost your legs。 But I see you have them back。

 Did the pen have anything to do with that。 Elon Musk it。Thank。对。😊，Yes。So。For everyone here。

 this is a really fun one because。One， it's challenging to kind of roll the punches。

 And like you can get really creative。 You can also see just how creative you are。

 just how stifled your mind is。 And for the person interviewing you。

 it's like your job is also fun because you're like， hey。

 what's the angle to kind of throw this person off。 Okay， When you're talking to people。

 curveballs are gonna be thrown your way。 A lot of people just get stifled。 They give up。

 They're like， that wasn't according to plan。 It's done。😊，Learn to roll with the punches。

 Remember this， Any kind of content you hear， the map is never the territory。Decide who goes first。

 who's the CEO， who's the interviewer， we're going to do 30， 45 seconds each。Three， two， one。

 go come on。おしい。Right。
