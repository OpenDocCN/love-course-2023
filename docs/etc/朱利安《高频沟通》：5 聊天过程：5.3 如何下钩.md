# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.3 如何下钩

Andrew。Hook me。Oh shit， okay。You cant he's going to think like let me start some downloads。

 get this lagin。😀Yeah。😊，嗯。How you doing， man。Good。系诶。Yes。I'm so in my head right now， oh my God。

 that's not hooking me。嗯。Dude， I got nothing， I'm so sorry you do don't let your mind tell you that。

Okay， so。Think again， it's， it's normal to feel this， right， So this is the whole。

For everyone here why it's also so important to take note of this make sure that on these calls you have a deep understanding of what all this means。

 but then you will have to go out and start small chunking it taking action on it to internalize it because it's one thing to understand it it's another thing to just。

Be that right so what we're doing here is we talked about this。

And notice how for everyone here is something where it makes total sense on paper， right。

 you're like， okay， hook and， okay， totally makes sense。 Oh， and then you hook。

 then you did this as switch of 50，50。 Okay， go off and then you freeze。 So it's very normal。

Here it's like a halfway step of internalizing off to God out in the real world to fully internalize it。

 but right now it's normal that it's that challenging。

 but don't let your mind convince you otherwise just go back to the basics What do you know about me。

RightAnd based upon all that information that you know about me， but every bit of information。

 ask yourself， okay， how can I？Say something right now that Julian would find valuable right so for example。

 what did Baylor do he used he saw that I did on YouTube onm doing these lives and I did a live about the show Loki。

Right so he was like oh Julia's into Loki and you know the Marvel stuff。

 so he brought that up he's like do you see the last episode so on a logical content level that that would hook me right just based on that situation because he knows that's something I'm interested in I'm like oh of course I'd love talk about this Oh wait what yeah totally。

Now you're not allowed to use that。You could go back to a logical conversational example。

 you could also go into a vibe example as we talked about if you talk about something you're really into and if it's authentic I might get sucked in。

 maybe I won't， but then you have to just shift topics remember you want to be prepared to talk for one to two minutes through a wide range of things that based on the information you already know about me I'll hit on something that I might find valuable。

Okay， so try something。嗯。So recently。I was in a friendship。Where it had gone very sour and。

Some of the things that we've been talking about， I' am starting to notice it in。

That situation that had occurred。It's happened a few months ago back in February。

 that doesn't hook me。啊，对，O。I like it though， again， now you're trying stuff good。

 so don't let your mind say no， no， no， there's nothing now you're trying stuff。Right。

 so what's something else？嗯。Don't let your mind talk you out of it。

We will not change speakers until I am hooked。我 my god。嗯。If you have trouble。

 you can also narrate what's going on through your mind right now， narrate that voice in your head。

 Well I'm just trying to find something of value that you might like。

 and I I'm doesn't necessarily have to be that。 So it's like you could ask like you could again。

 that's the first layer。 It's like， okay， what's some topic that this person would like。That's good。

 but then what about the your reality your rules， what about talking about something that you love so much youd draw me in。

Remember， you're opening your hooking。Sometimes you'll see someone。 who'll be like， oh。

 I know that that person would be into like， say inside a Marvel convention。 Oh。

 I know if Id say Loki， this person can be into it。 great。

 Sometimes you're not in a marvel convention。 Sometimes you see someone and you know nothing about him。

 H him。Here， you know a little bit about me。 if you can't play into it。 that's still fine。

 You don't have to know all that。 Hook me。 I'm human。 Hook it。Have you ever tried Wiimph。

 the WIimp ho method， excuse me？I have yeah。Did you like it？It was cool？That was cool。Okay。D， I just。

I'm like literally shaking oh my god，um here's another good perspective right。

 you can hook someone by talking about something they love。

Or you can talk about something they have no idea。And because I have no idea about it。

 and I'm very intrigued as long as you are。So I'm a big Star Wars nerd and my favorite episode is episode three。

喂。Man， doesn't sound like you are， that sounded like the fakest Star Wars fan。

Especially someone who likes episode three。Basic one is just asking yourself， okay， in life。

What excites you like what what and I know like for everyone again， like。

There's probably going you have to do inner work for a lot of this。

 but like if you audit your life or your day。Not all the thoughts in your head are necessarily bad or self attack。

Today or yesterday or the day before， what were the thoughts you had or the thing that popped in your mind that made you laugh or excited you or made you feel good。

Don't tell me nothing。はい。I'm trying so hard。By the way， this is good。

 this is that resistance that stifness on one hand。

Let go of right so this is where you want to combine these sensations with a release。He there。

 but then also this is the situation and the feeling that you will be faced with when you go out in the real world and start applying this。

And this is also why I'm not letting you off the hook because I know it's easy to be like， oh， no。

 it's fine here you at this， but this is one where you're're you're going to hear that voice like just give up。

 just give up， it's like you're going to find every reason to try to lay yourself out the hook。

 don't。Find a way。Okay， there's no churnning back now， Nan， you're in it。 You're in the deep。

 what is it， you're in the end game now was that we're in the end game that was like so much for beingna Marvel。

 a， Star Wars is better， but not episode 3。Yeah。系。嗯。啊。So。Before all of my inner work， I used to。

Play a lot of video games。And。I， I don't know。 I。Youre that a good start。

 but notice we also talked about this in earlier call remember there's features and benefits。

 what are your benefits right so you play video games cool。Ask yourself， you're in my shoes。

 Why do I care， hook me with that， Why would I care about video games。

 Tell me what what are you going to tell me that's exciting about fucking video games。Lead with that。

 then get into it。嗯呃。Is there could be something really good there right， so you went like。

 here's my story。When I was younger， I played a lot of video games。That's good。

 but it's just not a good lead in right， so think of even a YouTube video， I could be like， hey。

 this is Julian and here's my story did it and I start leading into with that。

You might still be hooked because you've watched previous videos of me， but if you're a new viewer。

All you're going to be thinking is， okay， what do I care about your story versus， hey。

 this is Julian in this video。We're gonna to see how letting go really takes your social skills to hold their level。

 So here's my story。 bang now you know where the story's going。 And now you know it's in it for you。

 It's like， oh， through this story， I'm going learn how letting go actually takes my social skills to hold their level。

 This is a very simplified example。 But yet it's like。😊。

I kind of lead it like that right now you're like， so when I was younger in video games。

 the whole time on thing is。Dude， what do I care my cool story。

 What do I care So you got to hint at something that shows me why I need to care about the awesomeness that you're about to share。

Go。😡，You can be like， join so。Be like， you know， off top of my head if I was going to talk about a video game。

 a video game， be like so。So check this out， you want to know the craziest things about video games。

 so when I was younger， you know， I played a lot of video games。There you go， oh shit。

 I'm going to find out about the craziest thing about video games here we go。

 buckle my fucking seatbelt。嗯。I'm understanding what you're saying， I just you can do it。

 don't tell yourself you can't， don't let your mind trick you out of this。That at it。

 give me the video game， excite me with some video games。ok。好ello。

So I used to play a lot of video games， Julian and。

One of the main games I used to play was Call duty。Day in and day， day and night。

 I would play this nonstop， just go in。All day with my buddies just playing video games。

 playing call duty， which one？Call duty model for three， I used to grind a lot to get like these。期间诶。

24 kills you would get like this mother of all bombs and it was just like destroyed like everyone on the map and just。

Pretty much assert assert dominance over everyone。It was like one of my favorite things to do and and to get and。

A lot of it was。I would like set a lot of goals and I would just always constantly grind。

I really don't know where I'm going with this， but it was just like super fun for me and yeah。Well。

 nice dude， kind of the end kind of stumbled off， but you did hook me。You actually did。

 Notice I locked in like， wait， which one， Wait on the mother of all bombs， Wait， what？

 And you were actually smiling bit。 Theres some good vibes like。😊，I was hooked， man。Awesome。

 but notice too， it's like， so then the next phase for you is being able to do this at will。

Being able to maintain it， but then also noticing。Oh， he's hooked。

 like did you notice that was hooked？I'm not going to lie， I looked away from the screen but。

So that's the next phase， but even to just notice like oh， he asked a question about it。

 I wouldn't ask a question if I didn't care。Right， if you're talking about something， I'm like。

And we'd be like， wait， which one， which call dude did you play？right， notice， oh。

 he showed interest， oh， was it trying for a poor kind of was like I actually did want to know。

 I would feel a bit of bummed if you didn't tell me which one you played。

There's some emotional investment。 Nope， he's hooked， awesomesome， let's vi。

And that's where if I were you， I would have flipped it around and it' like， oh， which one？

I'd have been like， oh yeah， you know， it was this one。 Have you replied。Flip it around。

 throw it back to me now， let's go to the 5050， Why are you hogging at all？Yeah。

Right that but notice how fast this happens， right。

 Because we see this on paper and we think it's gonna be this 15 minute thing。 But it's like， no。

 it's super fast。 It's like， hey， you know， Call dude。 you ever play。 I'm like， oh yeah。

 There you go。 Now you hooked。 You hooked me， ask the question。 You throw it back to me。

 We're now in viing。😊，All you needed was 10 seconds to call a duty。是。goingYeah， right。No。

 I want you to take in that win and be like， oh， shit。

And then notice that you stumbled off it you stumbled off because you didn't notice you had already hooked。

And then if you keep on going if that involving me， I' be like， well， fuck this guy。

What if I want to talk about call duty as well？Oh shit， Kyle， please do it。

I hope everyone's clapping behind here， massive props， like for real dude。

There's a good reference of like， just don't let yourself off the hook。

 Like your mind is gonna pin resistance。 Let go of it at home。 right， for sure， dive into it。

 Let go of this， But otherwise， don't let yourself off the hook。

 Keep on trying and notice how it can happen very fast and it tends to be a lot easier， right。

 We tend over complicated。 Always your remind， The answer is always easy。 if you're like。

 just bring it back to the basics。 Hey， what do you love talking about。

 what's one thing comes to mind。 You're like， oh， you know the video game。 Oh。

 that's not good enough。 No， it is， Try it， see。😊，Something's always better than nothing if it doesn't hook just immediately change topics like if you went。

 oh， you know I was playing video games and you just saw me be like。Oh。

 and it also makes me think of， did you have or like？Actually。

 I would transition to it like this to be like， so you know， when I was a kid to play video games。

 if I see the person not hooks， I'm like。By the way。There you go。 new topic。 By the way。

 Did you ever， Did you see， by the way， just insert the word， by the way and do a complete 1。

80 on whatever it is you're talking about。 And if that doesn't hook， by the way， next 1，80。

 by the way， next one， just keep going， by the way， by the way， by the way， till something clicks。

Okay。😊，But look at that， you plowed through and you did it。

 even though your mind said you wouldn't and couldn't。A win。Thank you。

 so do you want to hear a fucked up story？Sure。You do okay。I mean， it's really fucked up， I mean。

 I don't know if it's appropriate for this video， but I'm going to tell you anyway。So actually don't。

 don't tell me another story， I dont want to hear， tell me another story。Go， you don't okay。

 and tell me a non fucked up story and hook me with a non fucked up story。

 and I'm purposely saying that to throw you off your go to。啊。Do it。It's a。So。

You've heard of the CIA and actually tell me another not the CIA one。

 tell me tell me another one and hook me with that， not the CIA。But that's good。

 you had two ways give me a third way， hook me with the third way， I like it。嗯。So。啊。Let's see。嗯。😊。

I should have a million of these let's the plus side though。

 for everyone here it's like not to put you in your head。

 but you can notice like I'm smiling so you hook me with good vibes because you're laughing and it's funny so I'm like。

Give me in the next bite。Give me that juice。All over me， all over my face right now。は。🤢。

So Rock League is this video game where you play soccer with cars and it's this super difficult game and some some people just never get good at it。

You have to drive your car into this giant soccer ball and hit it into a goal on the other side of the field and。

People spend so much time playing this game。And the other day I actually heard about this guy who he's been playing this game for five years and he's averaged three hours a day。

 and he's still on the third level of the game。And there's like 12。Okay。

 that did hook me have people actually gone to level 12 or no？

They're like the professionals make it there， but 90% don't make it。Okay， one more question。

 how many hours do you think this puts in？Oh yeah， that's。

So this is actually kind of funny because I've logged 16 days into this game。S straightight gameplay。

And you want to know what level I'm at？Which one。Level three。呃。

Did you shove it in that guy's face who did three hours a？你。I don't know。If if I met it， I would。

 I would。I would put it in his space like like like white juice。C him in the juice。
