# 朱利安《高频沟通》：4 分析技能：4.1 分析技能_ev

Analytical skills。These come through。Unlike emotional skills where it's letting go introspection。

 analytical skills will come through reference experiences。This isn't something that。

You're born with。You are born with that innate charisma。You are born with no ceiling is of success。

 like that 80%， but the last 20%。That comes through action。Right， it's， oh。

 I tap into my authenticity。 Awesome。 Let's go now connect with people。

 That is something you must learn how to talk to people， how to connect with people。

 how to read people， to connect with them better。😊，That's analytical skills。

 You can't avoid taking action。 You want to get good at talking to people。

 Go talk to a lot of people。However， you need to get the right references。😡。

Here are some common sticking points and problems that I've seen clients fall into over the years trying to do this。

Number one， is they going to go out and get a lot of references？

They keep doing the same thing again and again。 They don't learn from their references。

 and they think that the more they get， things will magically change。No， nothing will change。Right。

There's client that comes to mind who's like， you know， I've been working for a couple years。

 you know， trying to meet new people， say hi， and I go up and I was like， hey， how's it going。

And it comes off a little strong to that。 And it's like， no one really wants to say hi。

 And I've been doing it again and again and again。 I'm like， change your approach。

 What are you doing。Okay， so references alone。Now， you need the right ones。

 so you need to be learning from your references， adapting from your references。

 not in a way that compromises your authenticity， and we will talk about this。

 but you better be taking the data。Okay， you must also。Learn how to put the real you out there。

 if you're getting references where as we talked about。

 it's a line that's getting validated or you're being fake and you're like， if I put on this front。

 people like me， if I act this way， people like me， those are not good references。

 Those are references that tell you you're only liked when you're being fake。

 You're only liked when you're putting on that front。 You're not liked for you。

 and that actually hurts your overall self-esteem more than it helps。Because although yeah。

 it might be scary，' like what if I get rejected for being me。

 it sucks even more when you believe and you create that belief within yourself that you're only accepted when you're being someone that you're not。

And then another big one here is you need to first let go to see people for who they are。

Because otherwise。All those things that run you， they hijack your focus。

 and you will actually not see the world for what it is。

 and you will not be learning from those references。Say， for example。You're very triggered。

 Are you like， oh I triggered at all like that。 And you get in this very competitive state， U versus。

You might start seeing people as being out to get you， being very scary。

 not being on the same team as you。Right，People tend to have this experience when they walk into a new social setting。

 They walk in a room and they're like， oh， what's me versus the room。 Very competitive。

And then say they rely on momentum。 They go talk to a bunch of people who're like， oh。

 I'm collaborative。Okay， when in reality， it should be collaborative from the start。

 But say it's very competitive。 that hijacks your focus。 Okay。

 we have this thing called your R S reticular activating system。

 where there's just too much data to focus on in the world that we're going filter out what doesn't have value and zone in on what does。

Say your state of fear that colors your focus。 and that's what you're going to zone in on or even project onto people where you might see someone that in reality is very nice。

And reality is just waiting to meet someone。 But your mind will distort reality and say。

 there's someone who， you know what they seem pretty scary。 They seem pretty mean。 You know。

 how would what would be a good way to go say hi to that person so that they like me since they're so mean。

And what are you doing， you're not adapting to reality， You're not calibrating to reality。

 you're calibrating to that projection， to that distortion of reality。And if you truly believe it。

 you will act in ways that will actually manifest that。So to get the right references。

 you need to see the world for what it is， letting go。

 you need to put your real authentic self out there， letting go。And you need to learn from it。

 ego aside versus repeating the same thing again and again and again。

So you need both emotional and analytical， but the emotional is the foundation。Okay。

Analytical skills， really。Focus on the connecting side of things， too。

You can think of it as there's authenticity， but then there's also relatability。

The better you are at reading people， understanding people。The better you will connect with them。

We tend to think that it's bad， right， Oh， it's kind of mean and manipulative to learn to read people。

 And what do you mean， calibrate。 It's like， sure， if you're a terrible person。

 you could use that for evil， yes。But。That's just basic communication skills。

 You don't do it in a way to compromise your authenticity or still be new。 You're doing it。

 So it's a bigger win for whoever you interact with。 If you're able to know them and read them。

 you're able to communicate your true self in a way where they'll appreciate it and connect with it on a much deeper level。

😊，That's what the analytical skills are。 Otherwise， it just goes to waste。

I've seen so many people who have great intentions， great people。

But because they don't know how to act appropriately in different situations。

 they don't know how to read the room or read the person。

Opportunities just get closed off to them left and right。 And they don't understand why。 I'm like。

 well， you'd actually be a good fit for this person。 You'd actually be a good fear for that business。

 So， that person would actually be much better if they worked with you。

 but because they can't be relatable， done。Okay。And then when it comes to analytical skills， too。

This is very important。 There is a difference between， you could say。Backward focused willpower， and。

Forward willpower， backward willpower。This is all through letting go。

 But this is what people do when they fight the guards of self sabotage。Right， you're scared。

 You're like， make yourself do it。 Oh， I'm in my head。 I'm going to try to get out of my head。

 I'm it's like you're using all this willpower towards fighting against yourself。😰。

Forward willpower is really tapping into the analytical skills。

 where instead of using up all that willpower， fighting against yourself， you let go。

So you're moving forward。And then you dedicate all of it towards。

The expression of you being yourself and being authentic。

Every single person only has X amount of will power per day。Don't use it fighting against yourself。

 Let go， but do use it to polish。That expression of you right now in this moment。

 am I using willpower， yes。If I wasn't even to form a word， I need to use willpower。

To craft this presentation， to explain these concepts， I need to use willpower。

But the more you start wasting on， oh， am I good enough， What do people think， oh。

 am I good enough the bit about this， You just won't have enough。

So free all that up and then use your willpower of moving forward to connect better。And again。

 to dedicate it towards these analytical skills。
