If you think of the emotional skillsï¼Œ there are three strategies that people embark on to work on thisã€‚

Strategy number oneã€‚Is through habitã€‚So what does this meanï¼ŸYou realizeï¼Œ okayã€‚

 it's better if I'm out of my headã€‚ It's better if I'm confidentã€‚ It's better if I feel goodã€‚

 It's better if I'm uns stifledã€‚ It's better if I'm groundedï¼Œ so on and so forthã€‚ Awesomeã€‚

 How can I work on that directlyï¼Œ those emotional skills by having moreã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And this is the mainstream approach where everyone wants to have more moneyï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ more looksã€‚

 rightï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ if I just was better lookingï¼Œ I'd feel more confident And I'd take care of the emotional skillsã€‚

 rightï¼Œ if I had more moneyï¼Œ if I hadï¼Œ you knowï¼Œ all these awesome things in this this big house and cool clothesã€‚

 Yesï¼Œ I would finally be confidentã€‚ rightï¼Œ That's the having paradigmï¼Œ if I had more statusã€‚

 if I had better friendsï¼Œ if I had connectionsï¼Œ if I had access to cool thingsï¼Œ rightã€‚

 if I had even going dip deeperï¼Œ a scripted lineã€‚ that's the having paradigmã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒRightã€‚

 and this is usually where people start outï¼Œ right mainstreamstream will sayï¼Œ heyã€‚

 you can only be good socially if you're good lookingã€‚

 you can only be good socially if you have money and connectionsã€‚

 right or you can only be good socially if you learn the exact right things to sayã€‚

 that's usually step 1 when people embark on this journeyã€‚ It's likeã€‚

 I want to improve my social skillsã€‚ Howï¼Œ what are some cool things to sayã€‚ What are some cool linesã€‚

 some cool storiesã€‚ The more I haveï¼Œ the more I can allow myself to be confidentã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

So they try to have and have in halfã€‚That's a lot of the old school socializing adviceã€‚

 And that thereã€‚Is the wrong approach do an audit right is there still a part of you that relies on one of them which one is more important right if a genie popped up and told you I can give you looks or moneyã€‚

 what would you pick you can only have one of the two you'll either be really good looking and broke or really rich and ugly goã€‚

Or if the genie could fix one would be the first one you could fixã€‚

And that's just good information for you where you're likeï¼Œ okayï¼Œ I on my endã€‚

 money runs me more than looks or looks runs me more than moneyã€‚Rightã€‚

Basically list them out in order of priority what about status right social alliances like who you know what this really cool friend my friendsã€‚

 you know really popular my friends really rich my friend's really good looking that gives me permission right competencies having certain skills right oh i'm really good at this so this gives me permission to be confidenceã€‚

roleole playsã€‚That's another one when you're put in a certain role right like if any of you right now were put in the teacher role here like say I bounced out I'm like heyã€‚

 I got to go an emergency came up Simonï¼Œ take overï¼Œ take over the class goã€‚

Simon would actually step into the teacher role and just due to the dynamicã€‚

 it would allow him to be more confident than if I say called him out right now in a non teacher roleã€‚

Okay different role plays like that this is why even you hear in like you know different emergencies people kind of rise up to the occasion and suddenly they're super like you know plane crash somewhere and it's like you do this you go get that dinner know when they usually wouldn't be like that at allã€‚

Okay and then of course scripted lines scripted stories or it's like oh look at all these stories I have these lines I have that's the source of my confidence that's the source of my emotional confidence okay this is all once more under the emotional skill strategyã€‚

And this is something that you want to move outã€‚ I started out with thisã€‚ By the wayã€‚

 I started out with like trying to learn different lines and cool stories and even write down likeã€‚

 ohï¼Œ this would be an interesting storyã€‚ And likeï¼Œ perfect the words I would sayã€‚

 And it's just terribleã€‚ Okayï¼Œ because guess whatã€‚Here's another little downside to this strategyã€‚

 Even if you do temporarily feel this boost of confidenceï¼Œ it doesn't lastã€‚

 and it's not true confidence because you're giving your power away to that lineã€‚

So even if it goes wellï¼Œ you never tell yourselfï¼Œ ohï¼Œ that was awesomeã€‚ I deserve creditã€‚ It'sï¼Œ ohã€‚

 that was awesomeï¼Œ but only because of the wineã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo you're trueã€‚ You could say confidenceã€‚

 how you view yourself who you areï¼Œ what you deserve doesn't change at allã€‚

 It actually makes you feel worse because it's likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ people only talk to me if I have this lineã€‚

 It's not meã€‚ it's the lineã€‚ I got to compensate with even more lines because I'm so terribleã€‚Nowã€‚

 as thingsã€‚Evolve whereas you go a little deeperã€‚You enterã€‚The doing paradigmdiseã€‚Okayã€‚

 and this here is where your strategy relies on not what you haveï¼Œ but on what you doã€‚Rightï¼ŒSoï¼Œ heyã€‚

 the more action I takeï¼Œ the more confident I can beï¼Œ the more I can unlock that confidenceã€‚ rightã€‚

 There's this technique called building momentumã€‚ A lot of people rely on thisã€‚

 where if they want to work on their social skillsï¼Œ they realize thatï¼Œ you knowï¼Œ say you're outã€‚

I don't know at an environmentã€‚ say it's a networking event or somethingã€‚

 And you want to start talking to people and being confidentã€‚

 you know that if you just talk to a lot of people and you gather a lot of positive experiencesã€‚

 positive proofï¼Œ positive referencesï¼Œ eventually it will give you permission to be confidentã€‚

But you're still relying on thatã€‚It's likeï¼Œ ohï¼Œ I got to doï¼Œ I got to doã€‚

So it's the same as someone who relies technically onï¼Œ sayï¼Œ looks or moneyï¼Œ you're relying on actionã€‚

Rightï¼Œ I need toï¼Œ you knowï¼Œ get enough positive referencesã€‚ And then I can finally be like thatã€‚

 rightï¼Œ So momentumã€‚You knowï¼Œ different techniquesï¼Œ rightï¼Œ Ohã€‚

 I realize that if I say a story and within the storyï¼Œ I just disagree hereï¼Œ it creates a niceã€‚

 emotional spikeã€‚ And people rely on that rightï¼Œ or on just being able to talk and talk and talkã€‚

 You'll sense you're in that doing paradigm where when you're talking to someone and say you have to be quietã€‚

 You feel your confidence and your sense of value dropã€‚

You don't feel comfortable As soon as you're quietã€‚ You' likeï¼Œ they're going to walk awayã€‚

 They're going to walk awayã€‚ I' got to talkã€‚ I got to do moreã€‚Rightï¼Œ it comes off as very try hardã€‚

 You can never have a breakã€‚ rightï¼Œ That's the doing paradigmã€‚Andï¼Œ of courseã€‚That's the wrong oneã€‚

Strategy number threeã€‚Is the being paradigmã€‚And that's where it doesn't rely on anythingã€‚

 It's just who you areã€‚Because if you think of having and doingã€‚

 you're basically using these things as crutches to give you permission to be youã€‚
