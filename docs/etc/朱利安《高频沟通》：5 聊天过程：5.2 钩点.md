# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.2 钩点

From there， you have to understand， and you'll see this when tracking the R S。

Is that there is such a thing as what we call a hook point。 It's when。

A shift happens in someone's mind from， okay， who's this person where they saying to， oh， okay。

 they have value。 I like this person。Zooming in on the hook point。

 there are actually two hook points number one， I like you number two I love you and love isn't just here in the romantic sense it's I love you as a friend love you as a person。

 love you as a business partner you name it okay both exist at all times。

And both will exist on a short term micro level， as well as on a long term macro level。

Meaning there might be people in your life right now。

 that might be more on the outer circle of friends。They'll fall into the I like you hey。

 you know what you're better than nothing I like you and if there's no other option there and suddenly there there you're like okay。

 I'll still talk to you I like you you're you're okay again， I like you is better than nothing。

I love you is when you lock in， when you engage and more importantly， when you care。Okay。

 and people will be operating。In both levels。Right， long term。

 but also short term when you meet someone new。You should recognize the point where it passes the。

 you know， who is this and oh thank you to， okay， I like you to the who I love you。

And this can happen extremely fast to the point where it even happens at the same time。

 you could say hi to someone and。In that instance， you pass both， right one millisecond。

 they love you。But it could also be more gradual where it's I like you and then later on I love you。

 but there are two hook points， two phases to an interaction and you must learn how to recognize both of them。

Okay， in terms of hookPo number one。The big tells is。You're better than nothing， let's just say。

If you talk to someone and they would rather have you there talking to them than not。

You pass to point number one。Right meeting you're better than nothing。

 if there's you or no one talking to me， I'd rather have you。Right， or if it's a group of people。

 if there's you and the group， they'd rather have you than not have you。

 that's the I like you hook points。And that's good。That's the basis for a conversation to happen。

But the I like you hook points？Is where they'll tolerate you。

 but they haven't really seen or experienced enough of you to see your value。

So you always want to be aiming for the I love you hook points in all instances。Okay。

 even on a micro levell， I will aim for the I love you hook point all the time。

 even say if I'm traveling and I'm checking in my my luggage。The person checking in my luggage。

 no matter who they are。No matter what gender they are， they're going to fucking love me。

I do this all the time。I am for the I love you， I love you， I love you。The better you get。

 the more you value yourself， the more high value you are and realize you are。

The more you will only experience hook point number two， me here， even in this casual setting。

 my frame is you fucking love me， you lock in， you fucking love me。

 this is not a better than nothing， this is your locked in you take it seriously。

All the time and you should do it too。I like you good。Most people in life will be like， hey。

 I like you as a win， but you， you have higher fucking Sanders。I like you as the bare minimum。

You're going for the I love you。Now here's the shift。You'll see it in three ways， okay。

 three key signs， number one， the eyes light up。Okayay。So here's the here's the I like you it' okay。

 cool。I love you， as？Right like if you were to ask。

 say a question right now and say you start telling a story and your storys talking about how your mom baked different cakes。

 I'm going to listen。But I'm not going to love it right and be like， okay， okay。

 your mom big cakes okay cool but say suddenly of you said something else or you're like， oh and。

My mom as his friend is super into you trauma release and and starts talking about， say。

 letting go what's going to happen。During the phase of oh， you know， my mom bakes cakes and' be like。

Although my mom's friend， you know， trauma released。You're going to see my eyes like just my RAs。

 okay？Eyes lighting up RAS activation towards this has value。I'll walk in。

In terms of my communication， that'll change as well。Right from u cool。

 you know Yamabi case oh that's interesting right let's kind of the politeina okay going into the flow to try like I wrote Tr toality trying for a poor tonality。

Meaning on a surface level， their voice will go up towards the end。Right where I'm like。

 oh your mom bakes cakes cool oh and her friend， you knows she does trauma release wait。

 wait wait what what her friend is trauma release， what， what， what？Trying for a poor。

Chasing in a way。And then number three overall， they care。Do I give a fuck about your mom baking。

 no offense， no， do I give a fuck about your mom's friend who's into trauma release， yeah。

That speaks to my currency as an example。Baking， look for this。Can happen immediately， hey。

 nice to meet you， hey。You pass both great， but sometimes it can take a bit of time。If。

You're meeting someone and this can happen right off the meeting point but even can later on in the interaction always be aware of this right you can pass for example hook point two right nice to meet you and then you do something un' calibrated or that's just communicates low value in that person's eyes right you're playing battleship in the beginning and suddenly the value drops and it shifts back to I like you。

Oh， I love you， oh I like you。You don't want， it's impossible that I love you to have I love you the entire time。

 but you want the majority of it， the foundation， if you will， right to be I love you。

So monitor this in the beginning， later on， even people you've known for a long period of time。

 you want them in the I love you phase。Now， in the beginning， though。If it's only I like you。

 it's because you simply aren't giving them a big enough sample of who you are。

If I go up and say hi to someone I'm like， hey， do you speak English， I see you， I'm Julian。

That's a very small sample right you don't have much data to go off of to make a proper assessment or a proper judgment。

So that's。And this is a key thing to write down that's what newbies do right a newbie。

Goes up to say hi to someone。Prepare to talk for one to two sentences。

Someone who's advanced goes up to say hi to someone prepared to talk。For one to two minutes。

Newbie one to two sentences， advanced one to two minutes。

 one to two sentences is not enough data and the advanced person knows that。

The newbie's going to be like is this good enough yes or no and then they bounce so a lot of people who just talk one or two sentences and then leave and like oh got rejected actually didn't get rejected。

They simply didn't provide the person with enough information to make a proper assessment this happened like a month ago I was at a restaurant and someone came up to me it's like hey Julian I'm like hey nice to see you。

And then it went to， hey， Julian， I love your videos。And then silence。

And same thing right I'm like I'm so grateful'm like oh she。

 you love myself awesome hey nice to meet you so hey Julian。

 hey nice to meet you I love your videos oh that's awesome。Crickets。You can't do that。

You can be like， hey， hey， now you take it， it's like even though I'm like， hey， I'm like。

 keep going。Crickets。That's what a lot of people do and they need someone knew who they placed on a pedestal hey nice to be you I'm Julian。

Crickets。I don't know， keep it car。Make me pass the hey， I like you to oh shit。

 I love you like say this person like， hey， join。I'm like oh he it's he I love your videos oh thanks man I appreciate that Hey。

 you know what I was reading this awesome book about trauma release and。😊，Don't wait and what， bang。

 now we hooked， I've hooked。Now and I'm just using that example as a superficial level say value。

 but or there could just be value in the vibe or somebody like you got to keep it going give me that sample till oh shit。

 my Rs is like this is valuable， this person's awesome。

Don't assume that I'll just know it when you saying， hey。No matter how good you are socially。Okay。

 so this means give them a bigger sample and the initial phase of an interaction。

 be prepared to hold court 90% of the time。it's the old school 9010 rule。

 you're doing 90% of the time， right you're 90% at the cause。

They're doing 10% later on once you hooked。Once you pass the I love you point， then it shifts to 50。

 50。So at first it's you want to be at the cause， you want to be doing so they get to know you。

 they experience you。Then once they've experienced enough that they're like， oh。

 this person's cool and valuable， then it shifts to a good 50。

 50 where you're both experiencing each other and getting to know each other， you know。

 you're awesome。But not everyone else knows that。So when you go up and talk to people。I'm awesome。

 but I'm not going to assume that they know this。Some people would pick up on it very fast in terms of the people you're meant to be with and connect with。

 Some other people might need a little bit more time。

So when you start a conversation and this goes hand in hand with being at the cause。Go in。

 prepared to showcase a good amount of your personality。There's an old saying from yours， truly。

That goes like this。When it comes to socializing。And starting a conversation。

 a newbie will go up to someone prepared to talk for one to two sentences。

Someone who's advanced will go up prepared to talk for one to two minutes。

Without the other person necessarily talking back and partaking。So you go up you're like， hey。

 nice to meet you and they still might be like， okay， this person seems interesting。

 but I'm not hooked yet。And youll have to give a bigger sample of your personality。

 supercharge that authentic you for that person to realize， oh， this person is awesome。 Great。

 hook point number two。So be prepared to showcase that personality。This means on average。

 until you reach hook point number two。Be prepared to be at the cause 90% of the time。

We call this the 910 rule。Where you're going up and， yeah， you're generating。

 you're doing 90% of the time。 Why is that Because someone gets to know you when they're reacting to you。

Right now， all of you are reacting to me。Because I'm at the cause。But suddenly。

 if I was quiet and say you were talking to me or you were talking or you were talking to me。

 I would feel differently depending on who's talking because you're reacting。Right now。

 because I'm talking to you， I don't feel differently depending on who I'm talking to。

So if you want them to get to know you， you better be generating。And getting them to react。

 So they get to experience you and see， oh， this person's awesome。 Okay。

 I would want to get to know this person。 Yes or no。😊，So get ready to generate。 It's check this out。

 but also spice it up。If you say one thing。In one， say tonality or one vibe。 And it doesn't hook。

 Don't just say that same thing again and again and again。So you can on like， hey， nice to meet you。

 Then you might add a joke。 You might add some humor。 You might do something funny。

 You might get a little bit more serious。 You might say a statement of empathy。 It's like。

 you create。A lot， this big sample of your personality。

And it'll reach that point where it'll either hook or you'll realize， okay。

 this is one of those situations where those circles don't overlap。

Nice to meet you next people are extremely bored never forget that no matter how successful someone is to or how much you place them on a pedestal they're very bored people are all living within a certain comfort zone guess what i'm living to within a certain comfort zone and default to people is like anything new is exciting and amazing。

So go against the usual anticipated， you would say course of action response。

 spice it up and be willing to be playfully provocative。

And I underscore it like playfully has to be done and fun for provocative。

 meaning go against the grain a bit。Don't just say what you think they want you to say for if you do so you're simply a people pleaser and a mirror of them go against the grain a bit oh if everyone's going to say yes to this person when they say that i'm going to say no but in a playful way that spikes it like it literally spices it up hook point number two is when they start emotionally investing right caring。

You can sprinkle in some little things to kind of accelerate this。 Now， this here is not the stake。

 It's the spice on the stake。 If you do this without the right foundation， it'll be terrible。

And this could be。Talking in the form of being。Playfully， provocative， playfully challenging。

Do some joking around。Some misinterpretations。Sppicing it up， not just being all like， hey。

 this is me。 I'll do this all the time， by the way， even with like。

People who I want to connect with on a business level， even with clients。Same thing。

 You've all had me， like sometimes just joke around， like， make a little joke here and there。

 spicing it up。Right，F enough， too， if you're networking with someone。

 they're usually always used to like the serious networking talk。

 If you're able to actually joke around or say some crazy stuff。 they're like， oh。

 that's interesting。 It'll be captivating。Right， so。Being playfully provocative， like。

Even saying something like， so do you， do you live in L A， by the way。嗯。So anyway， stuff like that。

 Wait， what， what， Like just， do you live in L A， playfully provocative， It's playful。

 but there's a little bit of spice to it。😊，That would be one example。So sprinkling that in。

Can't spice it up。And trigger that hook point number two。But this is something to be aware of。

 starting the conversation。Hook。1， hook。2。Last thing with the hook point， a big。

 big reason a lot of people's social interactions go downhill is because they think they never hook。

 That's not true。 It's because they've hooked， but didn't realize that they've hooked。

And then they keep trying to hook。 And the person's like， don't you realize， like。

 what's wrong something's a little off here。It's like， you imagine someone like， hey。

 nice to meet you did it done。 You're like， oh， I like this person。 Hey。

 let's enjoy each other's company。 Let's， let's chat and say I just won't shut up。

 And I just keep trying to hook。 You're just like， okay， what's this person's like done。😊，Okay。

 so usually this happens really fast first few seconds， but can take up to minute or two。

 You got also like create opportunities for me to partake in the conversation。

 So even saying things like right and waiting for the answer， You get it right。😊，By the way。

 do you ever watch？You know， they're so loki？Do you know it， no， do you know Marvel？Yeah， I know it。

 but I don't So notice notice I'm waiting for like some partakees I don't even need a fucking full story。

 I just need a yes or no。 Hey， do you know done。I'm always doing that。By the way。

 so I was doing this thing and you know what a thing is？Do you。Yeah。

 oh cool cool just want to make sure it's the right thing right you're not talking about that other thing。

 you know。Not always the right thing。It fits right。Im just mess around。 So anyway。

 you know the thing it went with the stuff， you know what stuff is， right？Like。

 you know how stuff sometimes with a thing does the thing。Okay， anyway， just that， just that。

Now you're involved。Okay versusers hey， dude， so you know how the stuff does with the thing and the thing does with the stuff and then there's it's like you're like。

 okay， cool， but like I want to be like check it with me。I'm part of it。 C it together。

Give me my 10% that's all I want just 10% you can also incorporate different tests right where it's like。

 you know， see if you packed pass the hook point test where you're like。You know。

 if you ask a question， you're quiet。One， do they respond？If they respond rate。

 here in the I like you hook points。Two， how do they respond is it in a polite okay cool or。

Eyes engage trying for a poor car so you can create these little hoops and opens to see if they are。

 how hooked they are。or if you shake their hand or if you do like a high five。

Do they high five you if you're like low five， do they low five view？If you're like， hey。

 put your hands out。Do they do it？If they put their hands out and then you squeeze you they squeeze back little things like that can also be good indicators。

 but I usually don't like bringing that up too much because then it gets people over analyzingly it's too complicated。

 but you should always know where you're at in terms of hook point1 and I try to understand you sets in the at the start of a conversation you're trying to。

Cared the whole conversation，90 to 10。But at the same time you're trying to be the buyer so but you're talking nine times as much so that I can't quite understand its the difference between being unreactive and unresponsive。

The thing versus the place it's coming from。You can talk a lot while being unreactive and grounded in your own reality。

 you can also talk a lot while chasing for approval。Okay， okay， so it's ultimately it's like。

Who is chasing， who cares more， who's chasing more？V says who is doing most of the talking？Okay。

 okay。Not same same here， it's like I could go。Do a speech， for example。

 and say it's a crowd and you can be like， oh Julian's talking more because he's on stage。

 he's chasing them。Versus the opposite。Oh no， they're here to see D it。

Places coming from versus thing。
