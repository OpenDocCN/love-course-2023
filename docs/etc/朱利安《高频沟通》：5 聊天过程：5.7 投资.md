# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.7 投资

During this phase two。And really in the beginning as well。 but this is a key dynamic to be aware of。

 is investment。The more someone invests in something， the more they value that thing。

The more someone invests in someone， the more they value that person。

So this goes hand in hand with value。And you must be aware of it， okay？Investment。

 the more someone invests saying in you。 And this could be in terms of。Buyer seller， right。

 like reacting off of you， caring about the interaction， investing， like the more they will value。

 And again， what does value do as we talked about， it increases the sweet spot。

So investment isn't something we were like， oh， I'm going to use this to do that。

 It's just something to be aware of。That increases the sweet spot that allows you to communicate more of who you are authentically in a win。

 win manner。Okay， but be aware of it。 Always be aware of someone's level of investment。

 How much do they care。If the interaction were to end， would they be sad， would they chase。

 would they ask for a phone number or would be like， okay， next？Would they want to continue this。

 would they want to continue this at a future time？Now。With the level of investment here， too。

When you ask。For something from someone， it must be a proportionate and appropriate ask to their level of investment。

So。For example， say we were to just meet and I'm like， hey。Come all if you're like， already yes。

 we'll sit down and pretend you don't' mean to say I was like， hey。

 walk over all the way over there with me as an example and say we didn't know at all。

 I'm just a stranger， hey， come over here with me。😊，Most likely， it'll be like， I I'm good。 like， no。

 because there's no investment。 You don't know me。 There's not enough big enough sample。

 and I'm asking for a lot。But if I would just say， hey， just stand up right now。It's a less ask。

 So he'll be much more likely to stand up based upon the investment there。

 And then the more investment， the more you can ask for and vice versa。 if someone's invested a lot。

There's a certain social capital you have and you can ask for。

 say a favor and they would do it because they've invested so much。

But if you asked for that favor sooner， they wouldn't because there wasn't the same amount of investment。

So even when it comes to calibration， right， social calibration。

 do calibrate to their level of investment and don't ask for anything that is outside what they've already invested。

Okay。Makes sense。This is also why even if you want to。Have one on one time， what people might do is。

 hey， let's go to the other side of the venue and talk。But you're asking for a lot。

For someone to say yes to that， they need to have invested a certain amount if you ask too soon for that it's not going to work。

 but if you're like， hey， turn this way real fast and now they're facing away from say the group。

You're asking for a little bit and you don't need as much investment。

So this is something to be aware of big time。And then in terms of investment right there's emotional investment time investment time investment is good right the more time you give to someone or something。

 the more time you dedicate that's actually investing because time is a very。

 you could say precious resource that we have。However。

 it's not the most powerful one the most powerful one is emotional investment which we covered right so when the eyes slide up trying and for poor they really care。

 they're not just giving you the time of day which would be the I like you hook point。

 but there's also the emotional investment and energy and that's happening and that'd be more the I love you hook point。

 give the person room to invest。So investing is also partakeing in that interaction。

That's why if you're stuck in that doing paradigm where you can't shut up and you're just doing doing。

 talking， talking， talking。You're giving them no room to invest。

And if it's just this one person show and it ends， it's like， okay， goodbye。

For them to care about the interaction， to care about the bond that you're forming。

There needs to be investment on their end。That's also why it's very important to go from that 9010 to 50。

50 after the hook points and pause at times。Don't just talk all the time。

 pause and create the space for that person to also share and step into that conversation to step into the interaction to be a part of it and invest in it and then there are three other ways you can kind of spark this up and this is really again the spice on top of the steak。

 not the steak。Number one is create windows of investment。So what does this mean you could。

 for example。Cre it's basically creating an opportunity for them to invest， right so。

You could say'm trying to think of an example here。Oh， you can go if you want to， by the way。

 I don't want to hold you here。There go， you can go if you want to， I don't want to hold you here。

 and if you say that after you've passed the I love you hook point， they're going to say no， no， no。

 I want to stay here。So you created a window right， for them to actually， oh。

 here's an opportunity for me to say， I want to stay here， I want to stay talking to you。Oh。

 you don't have to listen this if you don't want， no， no， I want to。Okay。

Those there are windows of investment next one is investment hoops。And very similar here， it's when。

 for example。You have something that the other person wants right so it could be an answer to a question so say even something very simple like you' you're already hooked at this point it's like so anyway by the what do you do for a living right there's an example so what do you do for a living say say they ask you that。

Instead of just giving them the answer， which you could。

 you can actually create an extra hope for them to jump through and invest so it's like， hey。

 so by the way， what do you do for a living？You could just say， do you really want to know？Yes。

 I do there， another hoop， a little bit more investment， and then you have the answer。All， or hey。

 what do you do for a living， I don't know if I can tell you now please tell mem I'm curious。

 there you go， he created a hoop， what do you do for a living？Tell me first if you want to know， oh。

 this is what I do for a living。Okay， those are investment hoops and you can sprinkle those in。

Basically adding an extra condition， an extra requirement。

 an extra thing to say or do versus directly jumping to the answer。And then of course。

 investment questions right and these would be questions that would lead someone to。Invest， right。

 so if you and this can also be very contextual where it could depend on the situation。

 like if you talk to someone who。Let's just say， you know is。

A successful entrepreneur who hates say the nine to five and kind of looks down on people who work9 to five。

 that's their wholetick if you're talking to that person and say。

 you know that and you ask them so so by the way， do you work nine to five。

You know that's going to trigger a response number like， no， I don't I don't work nine to five。

Chasing investing。Right or so anyway why are you here by yourself Oh no I' not I'm here with my friends even though you know the friends are there so why you by yourself I'm with my friends questions that trigger investment this here once more。

 this has to be sprinkled on top if you don't have your vibe down and you're going up trying to be like did you want to know what I do for work you know tell me first it's it's just gonna be terrible like this will enhance a good vibe but it also make a worse vibe worse if you do it so it has to be built on the right foundation。

Okay but investment is key and you also really want to focus on this throughout any interaction without getting paranoid without getting in your head。

 that's letting go， but it is a dynamic to be aware of again。

 if you take this in the competitive frame it's going to ruin your interactions This is more to increase the investment to create the value to increase the opening for authenticity and connection Investment is one of those things where it's just a phenomenon and people can use it as a technique they can try to use it for manipulation just like anything in life or what we're doing here is you can use it to connect better right so remember there's two sides of the coin there's the authenticity side where it's you being yourself。

But then that also has to connect with a person， so you're not using it to get something from a person you're using it so that you can connect better technically more authentically and deeply with the person even understanding the whole idea of investment。

You know， creates receptivity on the person's end that allows you to， you know， plan that battleship。

 right， expand the sweet spot and embrace and embody more of who you are。

Right like there's certain things you won't be able to say to someone who's very little invested versus someone who's very invested technically what is a relationship。

 what is a friendship， it's a lot of investment too right that's why you're able to go deeper and there's trust and you can open up more to friends you've had for a long period of time or relationships you've been in for a while the investment itself isn't what gets the person to like you。

It's like it's that foundation of authenticity of you truly being yourself and the investment is something that facilitates。

 you could say the connection between you and that person So if you already have low value。

 you're very needy， etc cetera， et cetera investment will just highlight that if you're the shit investment will highlight that right so it's again。

 the place it's coming from investment is simply the bridge it's a tool and then in your mind too it's like don't rely on that that's not what's going to get you to crush it but it can help facilitate the connection or you're going accelerate the connection between you and another person like sometimes due to a context or a situation for example。

 you might have limited amount of time to connect with someone。So during that constraint。

 you could use the tool of investment to connect a lot faster and deeper with that person。

Right makes sense。And then the other thing and this is。Again， for everyone here。

 it's like that's the whole letting go side of things。

The the next challenge will be to be aware of this。

 but to not let it get you in your head to be aware of this and to still be able to emotionally flow and not get too analytical that it takes you out of the conversation right is that balance there and that comes down to letting go right it's like。

Finding a way to really take all that pressure off of you and get out of that competitive state and even being able to just be with the flow and engage a little bit of your mind towards the investment is like a video game if you take the first person shooter right it's like in the moment that's the emotional skills enemy comes out shoot shoot shoot focus on what's right in front of you but then you also have the map with the larger objectives。

One is more emotional， one's more logical and our minds are able to do a back and forth。

 but it's still 80% on what's going on 20% analytical so that's really what investment is if you're just like oh what about the investment map it'll you'll get shot you'll die so you want't always prioritize like the end the moment connection and you can sprinkle that on top or pull from this as you go。
