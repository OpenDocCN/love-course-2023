# 朱利安《高频沟通》：2 情感技能：2.7 核心身份认同

And the third， similar to core beliefs， is your core。Identity。

And this is who you believe you are in relation to the world。 So core beliefs， what's the world。

 what's the world， What's the world。Who am I in relation to the world？You can even say。

 what are the core beliefs you have about yourself？

And this includes what you believe you deserve and what you believe you don't deserve。

It keeps alive what we call ceilings of success。A great way to bring some awareness to your core identity。

 This is an amazing exercise and highly suggest spending time introspecting and reflecting on this is asking yourself if you could pick one fictional character from a movie。

 a TV show， a book， a show， you name it。😊，What fictional character describes you the best。

Not who you want to be。But the one you truly resonate with， you're like， that's totally me。Okay。

 one that I really resonated with。 This is zooming out more of the archetype。

 was the selfdestructive artist for a very long time。 That would run me。 That's how I viewed myself。

 And this would cause a lot of self sabotage because， hey。

 if I succeed fully in myself selfdestructive， no。Some common ones。People take on the victim。

They take on the sidekick where they're always helping others。 They take on the underdog， right。

 It's like， you know， rocky， where you're creating all these challenges。

 You just can't let success come too you easily。 It's always a lot of effort。 Goodwill hunting。

 right， The person with all this potential Spider man waiting for the magical moment。

 The Sp to bite them to finally take action and change and transform。

 You could also be the person in the background of the movie。 There no one even notices。

 You could be the hero who's taken all this action， but then is destined to be alone or the martyr。

 It's like， we all have this。😊，Bring your awareness to if I had to pick one character。

 which one would encompass me the most doesn't have to be everything that is you。

 But which one the most And what are some of the traits of this character， What are some of the pros。

 What are some of the cons， What are some of the patterns。And you'll be like， wow， you know。

 maybe I'm sabotaging a lot of areas in my social life to stay congruent and aligned to that character。

So we unconsciously say congruent to core beliefs and our core identity。
