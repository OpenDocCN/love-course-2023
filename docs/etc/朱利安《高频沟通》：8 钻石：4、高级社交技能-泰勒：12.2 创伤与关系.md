# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：4、高级社交技能-泰勒：12.2 创伤与关系

When I was younger at H say 22， you know， I would meet other people to date that were kind of at the level that I was at at that time。

 And I'm really happy that I never， know had kids with anybody like that because obviously the level that I was operating on at that time。

 if I would had kids with somebody like that。 I would have been meeting somebody at that level。

20 years ago。 And then that's who would be raising my kids。

 So the general view is that you kind of want to be raising this up to whatever extent is that you can。

 so that， you know by the time that you meet somebody。

 let's say that you want to have a family at some point， which I do recommend。

 by the time that you meet somebody who you're gonna to have a family with， you know。

 you're meeting somebody who is at a high level and who is a better influence on your children and so on and so forth。

 because I don't know if you guys had dealt with this yourselves。

 But a lot of what I dealt with growing up， was that my parents who I really grateful for。

 But you know they carry a lot of heavy energy， they tend to argue with each other or you know。

 get really aggressive with each other and things like that or with me。

 And so the problem is this creates like this kind of like little contracted reality。 Its like this。

😊，Ted reality where everybody's kind like' like you're supposed to be a family who loves each other。

s supposed to be having fun， but it winds up being that like you hate your mom。 you hate your dad。

 your dad and mom hate you， which you know that's gotta suck because they're giving up all that time and money to raise you you don't even like each other。

 maybe you love each other。 don't like each other。 and then you're bickering with your siblings and so on and so forth。

 maybe your dad has like drinking problem or beats you up or whatever it is much much worse and crazy stuff。

 But you see the main point， which is that there's a lot of heavy stuff that tends to happen。

 if you're operating and carrying a lot of trauma。 And then you're going out and you're drawing other people into your world that are carrying that kind of trauma。

 So this is a lot of what Julian is trying to show you is over the years we've definitely done a lot as far as go out and say this funny thing here's how to initiate a conversation。

's how to be higher value and so on and so forth。 which is amazing and is a lot of fun I think everybody should do it。

 frankly， But at the same time， there's also other levels to it where you want to。

Cultivating your own energy and cultivating who you are as a person so that you can bring somebody else into your life who's also at a high level。

 Now， the thing to understand， and this is where it gets a little bit tricky is that nobody is at some perfect level。

 It just doesn't exist。 So you know， no matter who it is that you meet。

 they are going to have their own challenges。 And in addition to that。

 And this is another aspect to it。 And this is very， very important。 you would think that somebody。

You know， say that you meet somebody romantically who's at a very， very high level。

 You'd think that they're no longer attracted value because they've transcended that。

 You know they don't care about high value anymore。

 all they care about is your soul and it's so delusional and it's so incredibly damaging because in the same way that you want to meet somebody who is attractive even if you're a high level person or very present to the moment they also want to meet somebody who's attractive。

 So so what people tend to do is they make this kind of mutually exclusive thing or it's sort of either or and what they do is they ignore that part。

 The way that I think about it is that you're connecting you know within the physical intelligence where they want to feel that spark because maybe you know you're the bad boy or whatever it is they want to feel that spark。

 but then you're also connecting at the level of presence or spiritually or intellectually And for example。

 one trap that I've fallen into over the years is that I meet somebody who's really。

 really intelligent and very spiritual。 And then I forget about the value part。 I'm like， no。

 we're gonna have all these super deep spiritual conversations about life in society and and we have。

But there's no attraction。 I'm attracted。 But of course。

 that's because the other person is very physically attractive。 So I'm attracted。

 But then it's like it's very easy for me to pick like you know this like drop dead G。

 extremely physically attractive person who's also a genius， also very spiritual。

 But then I kind of look like a lucky charms character。

 And but then I'm thinking that you know they should connect spiritually and intellectually with me。

 but that just handle the attraction immediately I'm forgetting that there's this other component。

 which really is no different from if you're meeting somebody at the bottom or the top。

 there's still that physical component， no different than there is with any of you in this room want to meet somebody who's attractive。

 So that's another component to remember is that a lot of people who I've seen in their evolution with this。

 they tend to get to a point where they say， okay I want to meet higher quality people And don what they wind up doing is they up dropping everything that worked。

 and then just becoming like this weirdo who stops going to clubs stops thinks that you could sit there in a Starbucks with like a little T。

You're like， I'm ready to meet the mother of my children。

 know right and you're sitting there with your tea。 just thinking that they're just gonna show up。

 Okay So what I always say is that， you， if you want to meet people casually just for some fun。

 go out2，3 nights a week。 You're gonna meet a lot of people casually for some fun。

 You're you're gonna crush it。 You're gonna have， you do that，52 weekends a year go out2。

3 nights a week。 that's like150 to50 nights a year going out， you're gonna meet a lot of people。

 you're gonna have fun， You're gonna have a lot of fun。

 But if you're looking to meet somebody who maybe you're gonna have children with or have a relationship with You're you should be going out7 nights a week。

 Okay， so in other words， if you want have fun and party， go out2，3 nights a week。

 you want to meet somebody to have children with or have a serious relationship with。

 you got seven nights a week why do I say that It's simple。

 if right now youre gonna create a business partner and you could only have one main business partner for the rest of your life。

 And now is gonna be your whole business。 How long would you be doing interviews for。😊。

Right you'd be like this is all I get。 Okay well， if you're going to combine your genes with somebody into a humanoid。

 okay， you better be pretty serious about who you're gonna createate the humanoid with。

 So you should expect that you want to be doing a lot of interviews。 But in addition to that。

 what do we learn from when you're going out a lot。 We get better at it。

 We get better and better and better。
