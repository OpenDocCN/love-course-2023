# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：2、需求感大师班：10.8 外部工具

For this here right on the external tool side really keep this in mind in the moment if it kicks in right say you're out socializing or middle of an interaction right or even before an interaction。

 you just feel that the needy vibe kind of sneaking in remind yourself of this number one remove the glamour。

 be realistic around what it is that you need right so say it's I want to say hi to this person right maybe I want to be in a relationship with them and I'm after a partner once I have my partner right So what happened once you need this kicked in is remind yourself of the dynamic you took a part of yourself。

😊，And you put it behind that wall， which is。Being in a relationship with this person by having a partner once i'm in a relationship with this person i'll get that part of myself back so that's what you just did so immediately remember that you from that place there's a part of you that is using that person to complete you。

Which isn't good so this will kind of get you to snap out of it already be like oh even be a little disgustive by it'll be like。

 oh what am I doing right， why am I oh oh like no okay so number one catch that。But number two。

 what will happen is。We will project some kind of halo effect。

 some kind of aura on this person and really turn them into someone or even something that they are not。

Right so。Back to my email nights to illustrate this point。

 I used to know joke think back in the day listening to music's like if I just had a girlfriend。

 if I just had a girlfriend， that if I did have a girlfriend。

My life would be complete no joke I thought that was the solution like you put me on a lie detector test I thought that was the solution to all of my problems in life if I just had a girlfriend my financial problems are solved。

Everything's solved， my future is solved， that's it。Is that true， of course not？

But that's what I thought， and that's what neediness does。

It distorts reality and creates this halo effect， this glamour around the person right where even the person themselves like you don't even see them for who they actually are。

You will highlight and have different blind spots depending on their personality traits to make them fit what you think will complete。

So remove the glamour， be realistic around。For example， the person。Instead of， oh。

 they will complete me， now they're just another person。

Okay oh even if you into a relationship hey it's not over there's no you know keeps on going there's no happily ever after right we also project too it's like you it's like they the person's so perfect you know they never pee they never po now they do as well they're human just like you。

Same with perhaps you might have a business goal if I accomplish that goal and make X amount。

Okay be realistic does that really solve all your problems no what does it actually do so this is step one it's like remove the glamour be super realistic around what it is that that neediness just kind of started obsessing and fixating on。

Next step is reflect on what you're truly after。what is it there'reafter？It's not the person。

 you might think， well， I just really want the person know。

 it's that feeling of perhaps fulfillment and wholeness that you believe， which isn't true。

 but which you believe that person will give you permission to access。That's what we do again。

 it's like giving our power away。I just want to be whole， I don't want to be that p man anymore。

 give me my other half。That's what you're after。All right， whatever it is that you need right now。

 it's not the thing， it's what you think it will do to you。

So reflect on what you're after and then learn how to give yourself what you're after。

 so on a more getting to the cause， you could say in that way。

 it means letting go in a lot of inner work， dissolving that split。

That's you giving yourself what you're after， you don't wait for something external to dissolve this split or to complete you。

 you do it yourself。But even on a more surface level saying here right say just like。

 oh I want to say hi to someone I'm really craving good reactions okay。

 well reflecting what you're truly after， what will those good reactions do don't make me feel good。

Okay， well， how do you make yourself feel good？How do you give that to yourself。

 how do you give it to you directly？Without。Needing or depending on something external。

That's the key and once you learn how to give it to yourself， you no longer need it。

 so say it's like I need someone to like me to feel good。

 you make yourself feel good now you no longer need the person to feel good。Right。

 so that's on the external level， this is where things like。😊，Embrace。

 exaggerate laugh come into play。It's like learn how to give that to you it's also on a more graphic example。

 what I call emotional masturbation， not real masturbation。

 emotional masturbation where what is neediness， it's like you say wanting to come right experience an orgasm。

But you self impose the fact that say you have no hands， so you have hands。

 you tell yourself I have no hands and you really want to come。And then what you're doing is like。

 I need to come， I need to come， how do I come， well？

The answer is out there so you're going up to other people。

 will you please make me come and of course you need them to come because if they don't do it for you。

 you're screwed。That's the reality of a needy person。Instead， we have to realize this， hey。

 you actually have hands， you can make yourself come， you can do that to you right now。

 you don't have to wait for someone else。Emotional masturbation right and when you do it to you is something you no longer need others now of course to get very graphic you can go up with the intention of。

 hey， would you like to join in great， but if they don't you're going to come either way。😊。

I know this is a very graphic one it anchors the point home， but it's the same here。

If you learn how to complete yourself， how to make yourself feel good。On a vibe level。

 it's like you're emotionally masturbating good vibes into you and you no longer need others or as outcomes or things to do that for you。

Learn to give yourself what you need。Beyond that， limit your use of social media and do not confuse it with reality。

Big， okay， social media is really one that creates a lot of FOO and a lot of need and a lot of unrealistic expectations。

where you might think that other people are living these crazy lives when that's actually not the fact the case right。

 realize that Instagram right that's just a glimpse into someone's life and it's a very curated glimpse。

Meaning， it's not the truth。Okay， what you see on Instagram isn't reality if you see someone on Instagram。

 for example， only posting。You know， photos like smiling all the time。

 You will be like that person's happy all the time。 I need to be like that too。 Oh， it's like， no。

 they're not。 They're human just like you。 Okay， don't confuse that with reality and really limit your use。

 I think using social media。Is definitely a smart move。

 you can see almost a necessary move in today's world and things have shifted a lot online。

But don't get used by it right use it， don't get used by it and if you're someone who uses it a lot and you experience a lot of neediness。

Then social media probably influenced that to some extent even in terms of approval now the way that people try to get cloudout is through social media right where it's like hey if I could just do something cool and post about it then I'll get the approval on social media people get hooked on comments they get hooked on likes I mean it got so it's so extreme how how much were run by this the people are so hooked on approval and fear disapproval that even say platforms like YouTube eliminated the dislike button because people're like oh just can't handle the dislikes be careful social media does have a certain influence so limit your time。

Next one is stop judging others。Huge， the more you judge others。

 the more you're creating unconsciously this reality where everyone is judging you the same。

And the more you're going to need to portray yourself in a very perfect way or else。

Okay I found that no joke some of the most needy people are also the most judgmental people right it's like wherever they' go they're judging they're looking around they're judging themselves as well it's like they're always trying to be up to par there's a friend of mine who's literally。

Not not so much anymore but back in the day was the prime example of this this's a friend in New York where we'd go out and like every single time we'd go out he'd be like dressed to the nines we'd go to a nice restaurant he'd be really dressed like you know very aware of like how he's eating how he's holding the fork and whatnot and it's like if we're too loud he's like hey don't be too loud you know it's a nice restaurant or like that and he was always like oh judging see that person see what they're wearing oh you see that aware of brands and stuff and this person was super paranoid anxiety on the flip side super needy and what it does is if he's doing that all the time what is he telling himself that hey probably other people are doing that too so you're living in this very competitive paranoid judgy must rise up type of reality and it is terrible。

So stop judging others by doing that， you'll start telling yourself no one judges you too。

 and it's a very freeing reality。Next one is learn how to have equal fun no matter who you talk to。

This is big right people are like I will only have fun with people who meet these requirements and sure you can have that intention to network with people who meet those requirements or to meet people who meet those requirements。

 but that should not be you could say a determining factor for if you will have fun or not right I have fundamental no matter who I talk to。

No matter who will I talk to for real， like I will have equal fun。

 why because once more I'm giving myself what I need， I don't depend on others to fill my cup。

 I fill my own cup。If you depend on others。Yeah， it'll be different but like this person can't really fill my cup as much。

 oh， this one can。But even in that reality there， what happens is if you think of right the the more。

You could say the more abundance you have the more carefree you become right the less needy you become too is there's massive abundance if you tell yourself I will only have fun talking to these types of people。

And let's just say you might walk into a venue and there's maybe two types of people like that。Well。

 yeah， you're going to have scarc because you just have two people you can have fun with and the rest is。

 that's it。If you learn out of fun with everyone， suddenly it's like massive abundance。

 way less neediness， oh， if I don't have fun with this person。

 there's a million other people I could have equal fun with。Okay， collapse your criteria for success。

Because this is another big one right people are like I need this， I need to do this。

 I need to it's like no， no， no， with that finished line， put it behind you。

What do you need to do what you're doing， you're already winning。Crush it。

 it's really collapsing that criteria。😊，By doing that， you will start winning。

 activating your winner effect and really riding that wave of positive momentum。

And then last one here is do a self love check in right。

 so notice how really wholeness and neediness。Lack of self-lo and neediness right versus self-lo andiness that's really the dynamic how do you let go of neediness not necessarily by tacking it directly but getting to the cause which is you are starving yourself from that inner approval from that inner love from that inner wholeness so again collapsing your criteria for success means finish bar behind the finish line behind you celebrate you're good your whole you've made it。

And self love check in means， you know， throughout your day or throughout your time out。

 you can even put a reminder on your phone to just like an alarm。When it beeps， just take 30 seconds。

 take a minute to just check in with yourself， give yourself some love。

 give yourself some approval by instead of rushing to the next other people like me approve， hey。

 let's stop and shower myself with approval。That there， just that。Game changer and again。

 schedule it in throughout the day three times a day your alarm rings， hey。

 that means it's one minute of me shower myself with love。

 showering myself with approval and just watch how things change。
