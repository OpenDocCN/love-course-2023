# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.8 赋格

There's investment to be aware of， but also qualifying。Value and qualification。

 there must be a balance， so this is how it works。You will tend to go in。

Give a sample of your personality， check this out。They will see the value。

When there's something valuable， it also create， oh， emotional hook point number two。

 emotional investment， so value， investment qualification。And this is where。

 just like setting the frame from the start so they know why you're talking to them。

You must let them know why someone like you。Is talking to them from a value。Standpoint。

Not from a contextual standpoint， where it's， he， I want to meet you or it's because of this。

 but from a value。 If they're like， who， this person's so amazing， why are they talking to little me。

And you got to let them know。Qualifying means letting them know why。

 no matter what the situation is right you're talking to someone like wow。

 this person's so great in the back of their mind， they're going be ask themselves。

 well what does this great person with so much value see in me Why are they giving me the time of day？

Out of anyone and everyone they're talking to， why are they talking to me？Right。

 especially if the person you're talking to has a lower level of just self esteem。

 that's for sure going to be the first thing that comes to mind it's like why me？Wow。

 this person really has their their social life in check。

 they know what's up why they're so interesting， they're amazing， I'm kind of shy， I'm not the best。

 I'm not amazing， why are they interested in little me。So you're going to have to let them know。

Otherwise， they're going to feel like something's off。

 are they trying to prank me or are they trying to scam me into something？

mSo are they pretending to be something they're not like this is just really weird this this doesn't make sense。

Value without qualification doesn't make sense。So as you go up show your again。

 amazing big sample your personality， you hook great， they're investing。

 you also in a way have to invest and you do that by qualifying the person， letting them know hey。

 why you're spending the time of day with them， why you're still talking to them， why you're there。

 this goes hand in hand with your intention right going in and letting them know why you're saying hi to them and then why you're sticking around and what about them caught your interest。

' it's telling the person what hooked you。They're hooked， but you're hooked too。

 otherwise you wouldn't be there。 So what about them hooked to you All these things should naturally happen。

 by the way， but you do want to bring your awareness to these dynamics。 Investment naturally happens。

 Q naturally happens， but be aware of it， being curious。

This one I do all the time where it's just like ask them questions right it's like at first you's kind of you and your own party joking around hey check this out right hey I talking and then something about were like actually this person's pretty cool and then you start asking them about them you're like by the way。

😊，What do you do for work， wait， who are you？You're curious， that's you being hooked。Okay。

 so asking these questions or even more it's like， wait tell me about this。

 I really want to know actually what about that like just showing signs of curiosity， not needy。

 but more so like。Wait a minute right it's like you're there's someone you're talking to you never you'd be like oh they seem pretty nice and then you're like wait a minute there's something about them what who is this person you start kind of digging digging for more information commonalities。

Right you can use that like oh that's so crazy me too again based on truth never lie just find commonalities it could be anything something even simple right it's like oh you speak English me too have so much in common right。

Showing vulnerability， sharing something personal， opening up and showing aside yourself that you usually wouldn't show someone you don't know very well or you don't trust a lot。

What does that show wow， this person for them to be sharing something so real and personal？

That is yet also socially acceptable in this instance。Oh wow。

 that's u they wouldn't do that with anyone there must be something about they must really like me。

 they must really trust me， etc cetera。Okay， so showing vulnerabilities and then the last one is the emotionally unexplained we're like。

 you know what， I really like you。I don't know why I can't put it in words just because right you don't have to necessarily give a logical explanation。

 but you do state the fact that hey， you know what there's something about you， it's like wow。

 you know what， I can't put in words feel like， feel like we just really connect。As an example。

Okay all of these are ways to qualify the person， but you must do this at all times right as your value goes up or as they invest keep qualifying otherwise that would be that the discrepancy between value and qualification will be too much the balance that it'll ruin it it doesn't mean that they won't think that you're amazing like you could actually go in with so much value what happens is you're going to too much value they're still going to say oh that person so amazing but they will not want to be around you or talk to you longer because they view themselves as being way too low or they'll think something is off。

So you have to qualify so when you were talking about the balance of value and qualification now when you're meeting someone in a friendship or a relationship or whatever you're doing。

 when you first meet them， you're doing that balance。

 does that continue further on after the friendship and relationship is cemented or is it on a lesser scale are you just magnifying it more because you're putting you're kind of putting your personality out there when you first meet them。

It'll definitely great question it'll definitely be magnified at first right because it's like you're going up and it's also like you don't know each other yet it's like who's this person so yeahll be you'll be much more aware of that at first。

It will still take place in the more long run run macro， but then you really。

 it just kind of naturally happens， you're not logically consciously thinking of it。

 but in the beginning， because you're trying to shoot up your value and really show a huge range of who you are。

 you want to quickly balance that with the qualification too。Just because it's so much at what。

 so it gets magnified in the beginning and then later on a lot less and just kind of naturally happens。
