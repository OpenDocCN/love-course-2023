# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：1、社交焦虑大师班：7.三个疲劳

This is also a great model， okay， the three fatigues decision fatigue， persona fatigue。

 self-judment fatigue okay， decision fatigue is when you start overthink or you get all paranoid there's too much theory and it's like。

 oh do I say this do I do that， do I say hi do I not say hi and again it's like one of those like pillars of social anxiety that drains you that keeps you stuck？

Okay， when it comes to decision fatigue， few things。Number one， take action。

Don't just watch content for every， you can say hour of content， take an hour of action。Okay。

 even less like for every 10 minutes of content， take an hour of action or more。

 but ultimately you want to always be balancing out content and action or you will reach this overthinking too much theory decision fatigue that will cause a lot of anxiety and really keep you stuck。

Okay， why？Because。By watching theory and taking action， you start internalizing it。

And then it allows you to add more theory， add more theory， add more theory or you get stuck Okay。

 an example I have not。Played this game all my examples it's funny。

 There's so many video game references， So I haven't played this video game。

 but Owen has and and he was talking to me about it。 So it's this game called zero Horizon Don。😊。

Um on on like the PlayStation and it's like this character and I think you're fighting like monster robots andum he said so he's like he hadn't played games in like years and I guess this was a game that he was like he played。

And he would like do a little bit on little breaks and stuff。And he was like， you know。

 I was curious to see like the evolution of。you know。

 video games like I hadn't played games in like decades or so it's like see what it's at。

 see the graphics and it was cool， but he actually said it was a really spiritual experience for him。

Wide because the way the game is designed and I guess it depends on the level of difficulty。

 but the way it's designed is it's really similar to life where。

At first say you have level one and level one。It's pretty hard。

 but it teaches you some basic skills it's like oh if I do this button this button this button。

 I do this if I do that button this okay I do this oh if I do this and I start scavenging stuff here it'll ask me to do this this this great so you do level one then level2 what does it do it stacks on even more complicated tasks so it's like now you've got to combine the three buns three buns that you learned in level one but now there's six buns on top of that six buns on top of that and ultimately it's this progressive learning process where again I've not played the game Im like and then it's this from what I've heard on the last level you reach this point where you're doing like all this crazy stuff。

But a lot of it's just autopilots and it's like crazy maneuvers and combos and stuff to actually went。

Now if。You had just read the manual for this game you're reading the manual you're learning all the different combos of buttons and then it's like okay play you would just be overwhelmed because you need to internalize the basics so you don't even have to think of those combos to add the more complex ones to add the more complex ones to add the more complex ones the same here with social skills if you're like give me the entire manual and we're going add and we're doing it all。

Way too much。Take some make it autopilot by making a autopilot frees up more mental bandwidth for more for more for more for more so it's the same approach when it comes to learning this small chunket combine it with action and then one thing that's really helpful here which I wrote down is macro concepts over micro concepts。

When going out and learning this？Focus on the macro。

 meaning let's just say here here's a micro concept micro concept is you might hear， you know。

 have relaxed body language。have relaxed body language， you know， a micro concept might be， you know。

 be aware of different facial expressions， be aware of。

You know if there's tenseness or any weirdness be aware of how your your tonality right be aware of all that and yes。

 those are things to be aware of right we also talked about again trying for reports breaking reports all important data。

 however while out。It's much more beneficial to zoom out and being like， okay。

 what's one thing that takes care of all of that？Right， for example。Getting into your body。

 getting out of your head。doing that takes care of a lot of those more micro expressions。

Right the same as hey。If I'm able to get into a really good。

Natural flow I don't have to worry so much about what i'm saying or worry so much about running out of things to say so instead of oh what do I say and I need to learn all these things to say learn how to get in a flow macro concept takes care of all the micro。

😡，Okay， by doing that， you accomplish a lot more focusing on a lot less。Which is really good while。

So that's the first one the second one is persona fatigue and this is where。Again。

 there's that anxiety where you have a certain image of who you are， how you'd like to be perceived。

 and there's a fear that people will see through that right they'll see through your front。

And there's also a lot of neediness around getting good reactions and validations to keep that front alive。

 okay for that， remember expression not impression， this isn't about managing a certain impression。

 it's about really expressing who you are and a good external tool to help with this is do something that breaks the mold。

Okay， for example。You know， this is an exercise I get people for years。

Say you go out and there might be a part of you that really wants to be perceived as cool。

 be perceived as high value。Um， you know， and be perceived as like like James Bond right。

 and u you're out。And might you'll sense it to this will really stifle you suddenly it's like well all the actions that I can take they better be aligned with this persona right what would James Bond do I can't do anything that James Bond doesn't do and then what are some good reactions that are aligned with being this James Bond persona and it's like this invisible prison that you're in。

Do something that breaks the mold so if I had a client like this say back in the day what I would do is hey。

 do a push up right now。So say you're out in a fancy venue even， do a push up。

What's going to happen right and I'm like maybe even do five， let's let's do five pushups。

Maybe even say， I going to do push ups and do five pushups。

Some people might stare and what does it do for you， this is the most important。

 what does it do for you。It ruins your chances of being perceived as James Bond。

That's what it does by doing those pushups and even maybe having some people like who's that person doing pushups by doing the push ups。

 you can't be cool anymore， you can't be James Bond anymore。So your chances that hope of like。

 will I be James Bond tonight， will people see me as James Bond？Ruined。Now you might think that sad。

 like， why would I ruin my chances， but is extremely liberating？Ca suddenly that little mold like。

 oh， it's like，All good。Well， if I don't have to play into like， oh， trying to be really cool。

 I can withdraw from that cool game completely and be me。Do something that breaks the mold okay。

 and the third one here is self judgment fatigue。This is a lot of that self attack， self worry。

 right， and a great external tool for that is collect and celebrate your wins。Okay。

 so you can also audit when you take action。What's that inner voice saying right so you take action。

 you say hi to someone and maybe it's just a minute interaction。Then you leave。

For most people as soon as they leave and catch this within yourself。Immediately。

 it's the self attack you should have done better That was terrible this person thinks this。

 why didn't you do that Oh and now they're saying this and this so it's a mix of self attacks I' worry。

Not a pleasant voice versus collecting that win。Oh， you said hi to someone for one minute， yes。🤧。

Give yourself some encouragement， give yourself some love， take that win。What will happen here is。

One， okay， you'll be able to ride this wave of positive momentum right where you're just collecting win after win after win。

 I mean even if you think of just。What you're doing here it's like committing to this， hey。

 you know what， I want to improve my communication skills， want to improve my people skills。

Going out and doing it going out and talking to more people than the average person would in their entire life。

Just that alone massive props。Most people won't do this， why people are way too scared to do this。

A lot of people， they can only be confident in certain situations right， hey。

 take them out of the real world because say hi to that person， most people freeze。

Just by the mere fact that you're doing this， you should be giving yourself a ton of props。

Because who else does this？Right then from there， not only are you doing this。

 you had a one minute interaction， yes。Always collect those wins youll why ride that wave of positive momentum and also in terms of。

How you internalize this and break down your references。

 you got to let those successes land if everything is always just self attack， self attack。

 self attack， not good。Okay， so this here， another key model。
