# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：2、需求感大师班：10.5 三个伪神

The three， what I call false gods。 Okay， these are three famous。

Needs right especially in the spiritual world the need for approval again I call these the false gods because these are really the three quote unquote gods that we worship in order to become whole right it's like have that split within I'm not good enough I just I need something externally to just kind of fill that void so we'll pray to the God of approval please God of approval shower me with approval。

😊，The other one is control， please God of control， shower me with control if I could just control everything and how people react and see me in every situation and outcome I would finally feel whole and secure and then the other one is the false God of security right it's like just make me feel safe and secure no matter what。

😊，And we pray to these gods now the way it works is that they are all very intertwined。

But think of it as at the forefront there tends to be approval and control and ultimately they both link to security I think if you could just get enough approval you'll be safe and secure if you can control everything you'll be safe and secure。

Now question for you here is which one do you resonate with the most。

 which one do you worship the most？If your default say to feel whole insecure is if I could just get enough approval or if I could just control things。

a good audit for approval is。Well， how much are you fixating on just getting validation？

Right if you're someone who also worships the false God of approval。

 there tends to be a big focus around getting recognition right you might also be inspired to be famous right the God of approval is the one that I really worshipped growing up right that that was my conditioning was I was much more on the approval side than the control side where I was just huge on like I want to be famous I want to get good reactions。

I want people to love me I want people to worship me so on and so forth now why is it this is this is pretty interesting right with fame if you think about it why is it that there's such an appeal around fame or being famous or getting famous the reason being is we think that。

That is the peak in terms of getting as much approval as possible right if you think of there's a certain reservoir of approval what'll fill it the most。

If I get super famous， if I get super famous， like say。

you know Justin Bebe or Michael Jackson like worldwide famous that's the entire world approving of you and look at that reservoir and then we think that if my reservoir is so full by being famous。

 for example， if suddenly someone disapproves of me it doesn't make a dent because the reservoir is so full as we think however。

 that isn't true， what happens with，Fame is that all that it does right and this is coming from me who's a very a list no coming from like a Z list celebrity what does it do it's simply。

😊，Gets more eyeballs on you that's it it doesn't change you it doesn't enhance you it just puts the spotlight on you and what you'll see too in terms of fame is that。

People project a lot and people also who have that same belief that the reservoir is so full。

 they assume that celebrities are superhuman and can actually handle any kind of criticism or disapproval because their reservoir so full so the default instinct is people tend to not be overly friendly right people we actually on the meanter side more ruthless side towards famous people because he they're famous they have their fame they have their approval they can take it right so actually for someone who gets into fame from that place it makes things a lot worse because you get in from that place of insecurity you need approval puts the spotlight on you doesn't mean people are going to approve of you it just means more people see you messes with you even more and then the default tends to be more towards disapproval that's why you'll see all these celebrities get so much hate and crazy headlines because their celebs they can take it that's the God of approval。

And again， audits your your motivation for a lot of what you do。

 right is it to get once more recognition acceptance？Yes or no， and if not from who right。

 who is it that you seek the most approval from right I would even do this deep dive and ask yourself when it comes to your parents right out of your parents。

Again， try to rewind back to childhood assuming like perhaps your parents they might still be here。

 they might not be here anymore， but back to your childhood or whoever was raising you。

 but say you take whoever was raising you， the people who raised you out of all those people who's the one person you care about the most approval wise right if it's like the classic mother father you know parenting did you care more about your mom's approval or your dad's approval growing up。

All， let's just say you could only get the approval of one。

 which one would you pick your mom or your dad？Interesting and then you can kind of reflect on that。

Okay， same about today， today， whose app do you care about the most？

In situations where you get really needy who's approval， even with anxiety again。

 they go hand in hand right， say you take that situation where it's like you're out in the street。

 go say hi to someone。Are you scared about the person you're going to say hi to what they think of you。

 are you scared about what strangers in the environment seeing you say hi to someone are going to think of you if you're with a friend are you scared of what your friend will think of you？

How are you being ultimately pimped out by approval， the false God of approval。

 how is it pulling your strengths？The next one is control right the false God of control and this here instead of being driven like oh I really need the approval。

 it's a lot of micromanaging right a lot of okay well if I control how I present myself if I can control different reactions if I say this maybe they'll say that if I do this they'll do that I need to control different outcomes I need to control what I do and what happens to me in life and there's a lot of this heaviiness and just paranoia around like control control control control control。

Okay， that feeling of also just。Liinked with anxiety like not being safe， being at the mercy of life。

 like again， having like that no control。And once more of those two really linked to the false Sc of security where why do you need the approval。

 why do you need the control because you think that if everyone likes you， you'll be safe。

 you think that if you can control everything to your advantage， you'll be safe， you'll be secure。

Okay， and in safety and security too， you can also add， you know， money。

Any kind of materialistic just wealth， the more money I have。

 the better my living situation is I'll be safe and I'll be secure。Okay， those are the false Scs。

And those there nothing wrong with aiming towards to win towards those by the way there's nothing wrong with getting approval there's nothing wrong with controlling certain things if you don't control things in your life not going to go very well at all nothing wrong with going for security right this doesn't mean like screw where I live I'm going to go live in the streets it's like no。

But there is something very wrong where with worshiping those things。

 with thinking that those things will fill that void within okay。

 and ultimately what you're looking for isn't out there right all that approval you're chasing。

You know whose approval you're actually after？Yours。All that control out there。

 you know what you're actually after？That healthy control and mastery over yourself。

The same was security that security you're chasing out there real security comes from within it。

 especially with life right life's just going to keep throwing things your way the classic saying life's going to keep life what will give you a true sense of security isn't trying to control the physical to like make it work your way it's knowing that internally you have the faculties and internal resources to handle whatever's thrown。

 it's like， hey， no matter what life throws at me。I got this， that's true core confidence。

 that's true security， it's all inner。Okay， and once more。

 there's two games that are all being playing outward in in word out。The true one is inward out。

It doesn't matter how much you fiddle the effects getting to the cause is internal。These here。

 these three ways you can kind of see how from that place of lack。

The general theme of your neediness。
