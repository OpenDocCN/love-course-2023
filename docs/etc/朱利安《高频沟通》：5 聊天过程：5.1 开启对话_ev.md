# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.1 开启对话_ev

Starting a conversation。Going up to someone。You want to meet them。

 you want to see what they're about， you want to say hi。

Don't think of it as you going up and trying to do something to that person to get them to like you。

What you're basically doing is you're going up and you're creating an opportunity for someone to get to know you。

Okay， that's what starting a conversation is。It's creating that opportunity。 It's not pursuing。

 it's creating an opportunity to display who you are。 Here's who I am authentically。 Is it a win。

 Is there a middle ground， Do we connect， Yes or no， That's all it is。

 You're creating an opportunity。That would be， you could say the act of opening。You' opener。

Is the first thing you say or do。Openings creating the opportunity。

 your opener is the first thing you say or do。Now。You're opener。Really does not matter。

So the same mistake people make with， where they value what they say over how they say it or their intention behind it。

 People value the first thing they say more than the rest。 The first thing has to be the best， right。

 or first impressions are so important。Now， of course， don't be dumb， be smart。

 act the best you can based on the information you have。

 but realize that the first thing you say or a first impression doesn't really matter at all。

This goes against a lot of mainstream。 First impression doesn't matter at all。

 First impression really has to do with that person's conditioning and what they might even project onto you or see on you。

It's not that important。That impression changes， the more data there is。

 the more the conversation or interaction。It happensapp。Okay。

 and the same with the first thing you say or do doesn't matter either。

 People rarely obsess over those little things。 They look at the bigger picture。

 There's not a single person who's like， hey， you know what。 It was great talking you。

 getting to know you。You're an amazing person， but that first thing you said， that first hello。

Something was a little bit off about it。 I'm sorry。 No one's gonna to say that。Okay。

 so take off that importance over the buildup and pressure in terms of what's the first thing that I say now。

 okay。Now， I wasn't saying hi to someone。Forget about first impressions。

 Forget about the first thing you say， but also。In terms of calibrating， take the data you have。

 so based upon the first read of the person。And past references， okay， based on that。

 the sweet spot should be around there。But then from there。

 always calibrate to the best case scenario。This means assume familiarity。

 assume everyone will fucking love you from there， lower your time of reaction。 Just jump in。 Okay。

 this will help。😡，Even before doing any kind of inner work。

 because what tends to happen is you see a situation。And then as we just discussed here。

 you're going to start projecting onto it and making all these assumptions right say you see someone you want to say hi to and they're with a big group of friends and all those friends seem really cool。

 very unstifled they're in the zone based upon say the standards of the environment or perhaps even your own standards they're all very high value and you're like wow。

 that's a group well here we go， there's probably gonna be a lot of assumptions that happen right the longer you wait。

 the more you're analyzing， the more you're assuming and you're probably going be like well。

 like say there's a group say one person who you want to say hi to with two friends okay。Any setting。

 whether it's stating business， right， it's like， oh， them and their colleagues。

 one person who you want to say Iune and two friends of theirs。If I give you five seconds。

 that's all you're going to see right oh， one person， two friends， who I'm in。

If I give you five minutes， are you going to see more than that？Yes， if I give you five minutes。

 you're going to be staring at them and start thinking， well。Out of the two friends。

How good a friends are they， who's perhaps the best friend？Who's the leader， What's the dynamic。

 How do you think they know each other？What do you think the jobs are of those friends。

 What do you think the backgrounds are， what's their personality type， are they nice， are they loud。

 Oh， where do I stand in comparison to these three people？All this analysis and if， for example。

 say you're in a state of fear that hijacks your focus too and you're going to start seeing all the scary things and projecting scary things。

It might just be two people that that person just met。

Kns nothing about them and is like just having a friendly conversation because it beats being alone say waiting for their actual friend say that's a real situation but you might be projecting oh they've been friends for years oh their friends seem very angry like they don't want to talk to me they're very protective oh you're projecting all this stuff and then five minutes later you go in you're already screwed。

It already affected you， you're reacting to it， and then calibrating to it， validating it。

So regardless， lower your time of reaction， don't even give your mind the option to start projecting and speculating the faster you're in。

The better。And this is something that will naturally happen too。

 the more you let go because if you have excuses， just make yourself do it so the excuses don't pop in。

 but as you start letting go you no longer have those excuses and if you didn't have those excuses。

 you'd go in fast anyway。Actua else do you remember， just jump in there。

See someone go say hi best way is straight line to that person no dilly dwlling don't half acid or kind of hesitate because people sense that okay people are much more socially savvy than you think and so are you and if there was someone who say very nervous and like oh like trying to say hi you would sense it immediately like if someone was thinking of saying hi to you and it was very nervous and walking straight and backing up and looping around and peering in you would know immediately。

Okay， if I'm out and say people recognize me， I'll immediately get a sense of it。

I'll even tell my friendss like， oh， that person they they know me from YouTube oh that person my friends's like no way。

 no way， and then later on they come say hi and say， hey， thanks so much for the value。

Immediately know we sense that it's like a human spider tingling so if you're going in and you're kind of orbiting around waiting for that perfect occasion。

 you're already screwed。The perfect occasion is right now， jumping。And then。Deal with it。

And that makes it exciting for you， right， it's like you don't want to be this social comemeleon looking for that puration。

 just get in there， jump in。If it was a friend you knew once more assuming familiarity。

 calibrating to the best outcome， if that was say your best friend。

And you want to say hi to them and they're in a conversation。

 are you going to wait for the perfect opportunity if it's your best friend yes or no？No。

 you're gonna go and be like， hey。Even if it's their birthday party。

 you're going to go up and interrupt it all and say， hey， because that's your best friend。

Do the same here。The same is say halfas right or going dabbling in and out， orbiting around。

 you wouldn't do that if that was your best friend。

You know where you would do that if it's someone who you know。

 deep down inside has a very high probability or high percentage rate of rejecting you。

 that's where you would orbit around。If you knew， it's like， hey。You can try anything here。

 but this person rejects， you know， out of the people who say hi to them， 80% of them。

That's where you'd orbit and start calculating and analyzing and trying to find the best opportunity to say hi to them。

So you're calibrating to a negative outcome。And that's bad that's the that's the frame you're setting。

 that's the reality you're buying into and validating。And if you strongly buy into it， they will too。

 and they'll act just that way， they'll reject you。You manifest that outcome you're afraid of having。

Think of it like this if you're someone who's so cool technically by superficial standards。

 you could say you would never get rejected so what about going up and acting as if you never got rejected？

The more half asset you do， the more you're sub communicatingic， I get rejected all the time。

 that's why I'm so careful and trying to preplan the best occasion。

If no matter who you talk to is always a great response。

 you would just straight line it to that person and say hi。

If you're not straightlining it to that person and saying， hi， you're sub communicating， hey。

 I got rejected in the past。Then weren't you half fast in orbit。

 I've got rejected so much in the past。It's terrible。So the frame of mind is you walk up。

 straight line and boom you're there。There was their life before you and their life after you and again。

 all settings right I do this myself right if I go to a party and there's networking or I'm at a dinner and there's friends or friends say I want to meet and say hi to I just boom hey。

 I was going just right in there。There was your life before me and now there's your life after me。

That's how you view it it's like out to magic， out of thin air you're there done so linking to that opener doesn't matter one thing I'd even suggest doing。

Temporarily。As long as you know why you're doing it is if you know that's your number one excuses every time you see someone you're scared to say hi or you just don't do it。

 give yourself some canned， meaning pre plannedned。Opener， an opening line。Do it。

 if that's literally the one thing that's blocking all the time。

 get a hand opener to get it out of the way and to start jumping into the conversation。

As long as you know。That that opener doesn't matter that's why it's okay to have a canned if you want like if a conversation goes well don't give your that power to that opening line so as long as you remind yourself of that and realize that this is just a temporary training wheel to just get things out of the way by all means go for it。

Right， there's。Two that I had for a very long time myself。And I would say even to this day。

 if for some reason， I don't have anything to say， I'll just rely on that。

One very simple is introduce yourself， hey， I'm Julian。

That don't say Julian but say hey Im whatever your name is， there's your opener。

 you know what say introduce yourself， that's better than doing nothing。You could argue like。

 but isn't there a better one sure， but it doesn't matter it really doesn't matter if there's a better one or not because you're going to see the big picture that is you。

And then another one is， do you speak English or do you speak wherever you are， the language？

Right same that you hear in America， hey， do you speak English and of course you're like， well yeah。

 nice to meet you， I'm Julia， there you go。Those were two that I've used for a while again。

 there's zero magic in these， it's not going to do anything for you。

 but if you have that massive resistance， it will eliminate it for you to just jump in and start getting some references。

And then as we previously discussed too， with the embrace exaggerated laugh。

 if you also don't know what to say， there's your opener just open saying， hey。

 I don't know what to say now you're in。In terms of walking over there too， walk fast， move fast。

 always with intent， the slower you go remember， especially until you've really let go。

 the more excuses， the more projection and speculation， so just straight line， jump in。

 walk fast with purpose， bang you're in there when starting a conversation。

Be at the cause and set the frame of the interaction。So what does this mean。

 it means go up and don't just be like，So hi， nice to meet you。And then just be quiet。

 you're at the cause。You're going to have to lead。 They're like， okay， what does this person want？

But also set the frame， meaning。Why are you talking to them？ This must be known。Okay。

 imagine right now you're out grocery shopping。Right。Actually， visualize it。

 You're in like the vegetable section your grocery shop in and say someone comes up to you。

 and they're like， hey， how's it going。I'm Julia。You're gonna be like。诶y。Hey， so your day going good？

What are you going to think of like， what does this person want， Why are they talking to me。

 Let me get my vegetables， right， like， so see you any good movies lately。It's going to be so weird。

 right， You're going to be like， well， O， like all of that would actually be acceptable if they knew why you were talking to them。

If you even just said something like， say say you moved to town， you're like， hey。

 just moved to town I just， you know， just new in town just want to say hi， Okay， cool。

 and nice to meet you。 They'd be much more receptive。

 But until you make it clear that this is why I'm talking to you。

 that concerns gonna to be on their mind and it's going be very weird。So with everyone。

 they must know this doesn't necessarily have to be verbalized。

 but they have to know why you are saying hi， why you are talking to them。What's the context。

 you looking for friends， I it a relationship are you looking for a business partner。

 are you looking for it like， why are you talking to that person？That must be known。

 You must ask yourself， at all times， do they know。And， B。

Real and authentic in setting the frame and letting them know from the start。What a lot of people do。

 especially with fear， is you go into the people， please， or you're like， hey。

 this is actually why I'm talking to you when it's not why you're talking to them at all。

 And then later on， you're like， actually， was this。No， no， no。 From the start， this is who you are。

 This is what's up。 Take it or leave it。Okay。The frame that I really take。

When saying hi to someone when starting a conversation is always， check this out。

 and this really encompasses all these principles。 It's not， hey， will you like me， It's， hey。

 check this out。And I offer value。It's like you have this party going with yourself。

 this inside joke with yourself， and you're like"Hey， check this out。

Or if you're talking with your friends， you could be say talking about a movie and like。

 say someone's walking behind or like， hey， by the way， what are your thoughts on this movie。

 Check this out。 It's a question。 It's offering value。And it's join the party。

You are inviting them to join your party。Not the opposite， not please let me join your party， please。

 no。 and then of course， don't pursue a attract。What most people do is they whatever they're saying or doing is going to the other person。

 It's like I'm sane or doing。The reaction comes back to me。 If it's a good 1， I feel good。

 If it's a bad 1， I feel bad。Here， what you're saying or doing is to you。To me。

 I feel good that transfers onto them。Okay， that is you。You could say doing to you and attracting。

Versus pursuing。Then。In terms of starting conversations， there is a big focus on， well。

 should you be just very direct or indirect？There is no such thing as being indirect。Why。

 because you're letting everyone know why you're talking them from the start。

Your intentions should always be real。Being indirect， if you actually are like direct。

 that's like being fake。However， in terms of the verbals， you can say whatever。

 you can be direct asking for directions。 For example， sayy I want to meet someone It's like。

 you seem cool。 You'd be like a cool friend。Sa that was my intention。 I'd go and be like， hey。

 by the way， do you know where the event is？But it's still direct in the vibe。The same is， hey。

 nice to me。 you seem pretty cool。 Want to say hi。Verbals don't matter。

But intention is always direct， is always real。And then。Last thing here。

When you see someone you want to talk to， straight line for that person。Go straight up。

 approach directly， don't try to wait for a perfect situation。 Just jump in。

You that person who's like， hey。Out of the blue Here I am。 Here's this awesome opportunity。

 Nice to meet。 One thing I found I actually went out the other night and found this happening what you was saying about how you have that。

 like。😊，Kind of subconscious frame before going into going up to someone and if you don't if you have that kind of negative mindset or you feel like you're lower value than them kind of mindset it just the interaction will not go well like you're kind of already setting that。

Yep and I can definitely feel that now within myself even before approaching someone like I'll approach person A and it will just be fun good like everything's amazing with viing and then we just like go through I think about approaching person B and there's just that resistance there's just that feeling like you know that like cringe within myself and I'm almost like I almost know you know what if I actually go up and talk to this person it won't go well and then lo and behold it doesn't right you go up and it's like hey and they're like why you know it gets like that kind of feeling So I guess if I detect that in myself in the moment and I have that feeling of resistance that feeling of like oh shit like going up to talk to this person right what can I sort of do I know there's like the letting go work I can do sort of holistically what is there anything to be done in that moment like if I'm out and I'm not out or something to help with that say yes at home of course or even while out letting go 100%。

But then there could be some other factors too where it's like okay letting go say of the fear or even of viewing yourself as low value。

 there's a stifleness where you place someone above you so it's like by what standards like why am I placing them above me。

 why do I assume it wouldn't go well？And then on a more practical stance it's and this is the bullet that I added。

 it's remind yourself like， you never know。Like no matter no matter how much you let go， by the way。

 this will help give you as clear as of a realistic view as you can。

 but you never know there's some situations where I went up and said hi to someone and I thought it would not go anywhere and it would amazingly well other situations i like it's gonna be amazing and it didn't go me well you really never know so instead of prejudging it it's always be hey let's find out let's find out and jump in and the best way to go about it too is。

The old embrace exaggerated laugh。You're out of state， you feel yourself low value。Embrace it， go up。

 use that as your opener， exaggerated to the point where you laugh at it once you're able to genuinely laugh at it。

It's hold over you as gone。So literally you go like， hey， you know， I'm extremely low value。

 I was going to try to let go in the bathroom， but hey， here I am。

And if you genuinely say find that funny as an example， bang that change this funny thing， remember。

 embrace exaggerate laugh， embrace exaggerate laugh。

You can apply this to anything plus creativity in terms of how you do it。

That on a more technical level。Makes you invincible。Because no matter what is thrown your way。

 no matter what outcome you're facing， what happens。

 you can always embrace your exaggerate your laugh， your way intos。Game change。
