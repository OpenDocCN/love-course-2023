# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.6 建立舒适感

Now during this phase two， this is again， the foundation。

 there are some things that you can bring your awareness to。

 but do make sure that what we're going to cover here is on top of this foundation of just vibing for the sake of vibing。

 don't make this the new outcome because then this will take away from vibing。Okay， and that is。

Building comfort。During this time yeah you're vibing it's like you get yourself in that nice translike state and then you do want to focus on comfort right and what does comfort also do is we talked about it expands that sweet spots where authenticity and relatability overlap。

Okay， so there's a lot of misconceptions around what it means to build comfort。

 what is building comfort， what is comfort， like how to even do it。

 this is what I found in my experience。Comforts， what it really means is togetherness。

That's all that it means it's building togetherness it's not logically telling someone about you in your life right it's not the more they know about me。

 the more there's going to be comfort people really treat it like this resume exchange where they're like here's my resume what's yours let's you want me to list out more details on my resume do you get to know me now is there more comfort because you know more about me and I know more about you no no no no。

It's not that it's togetherness say right now you were put with a partner that you don't know is stranger。

And both of you were dropped on this deserted island and you have to survive for seven days。

 but you're not allowed to talk the entire time at the end of those seven days there's going to be a lot of comfort between the two of you。

 even though you know nothing about each other even though you don't talk to each other at all why because you've gone through a lot together and that's really how you build this togetherness okay it's by going through example。

Tons of topics， tons of emotions， tons of environments。The more that happens。

 the more there's togetherness。That's also why even if you look at long term friendships。

 you might not even talk that often， but because there's that factor where you've gone through a lot。

 that togetherness is there。That's the foundation， creating togetherness。

It's also the difference here。In terms of topics between deep rapport and wide rapport。

 there is such a thing as wide rapport versus deep rapport。I like both。

 but people tend to think that deep rapport is the only thing that builds comfort。

 What is deep rapport， It's when you talk about one topic for a very long period of time。Right。

 say you bond with someone over。Let's just say music。 And you just keep talking about music。

 and you have this artist。 You're both super fans of， and you talk about it。

 And that's all you talk about。 You might think that， oh， look at that。

 We spent an hour talking about this band and this music。 and we went so deep。

 And we had so much in common with the band。 A lot of comfort。 Yes， that's comfort。

 But that's deep rapport， deep comfort。 And this can create some bond。

 but not as much as if you actually did wide。😊，And it can actually。

Hurt you in the future because it can make things awkward where the person's like， well。

 if I were to hang out with this person again， could we talk about anything else？

Or can we only relate when it comes to music， did we exhaust the topic。

 would it be awkward if we talked about anything else， it's not the best。

W is when you just go through topic after topic， it makes me think of this like just fully ADD。

I talked about how in the initial few minutes of my interactions， usually。

 I just ask a lot of questions， that's what I do。I was like， oh are you from L， by the way。

 what's your favorite movie， Your parents divorced like anything。 Just question， question， question。

 question， question。 And by going through all that together， massive comfort。 So it accelerates it。😊。

And then if there is something that genuinely I'm excited about， yeah， I'll go the deep rapport。

 but wide rapport， especially in the earlier stages of an interaction of getting to know someone。

 whatever the context may be， is much more powerful than deep rapport in the vibing phase and any interaction。

 more topics you go through the better， go through a ton。

 the more emotions the better and the more environments。

 moving people around in different environments， all this creates togetherness。

 we've gone through all this together， there's now this solid bond。Okay。Another thing。

That amplifies this is one on one time， meaning the more it's you and one person。

 it's going to be a lot more powerful than if it's you and a person and。

As someone they know or two people they know。RightThat still creates comfort。

 but the more you can get one on one time， the better in all situations。

And one on one time doesn't necessarily mean。You know say it's like a networking event say hey come with me over there no sure that would do one on one time。

 but one on one time can simply be cutting off from the group conversation so it could be you know。

 moving so that the person is facing away from the group。And just talking to you。

 even though you're still in the group setting because they're not facing away they see you。

 that increases one on one time， but even if they don't face away。

 if suddenly the groups having a conversation and you and the person are just having your own conversation separate that also helps massively okay。

 one on one time once more togetherness。And then a few other things in terms of topics that you can do that increase this。

 number one， conspiracy theories。Right anythings anything where you're in on it together right so even dumb little jokes you can do this。

 you know， say you're out it's like hey， you know， chatting with someone and then like look around and be like you know。

How do you think those people know each other？Just something like that， hey。

 how do you think those people know each other？Or what do you think that person does for a living。

 by the way？Any environment you ask that now what happens the dynamic is you and the person。Versus。

The environment versus the world right looking at another person and now making a decision together。

 it's like you're in on it together。What does that do increases togetherness？

And there's many ways to do this， like pointing at the environment。

 anything where it's like you two as a team。There's this old school kind of cheesy game。

Called fuck Mary kill right where it's like pick three people in the environment， who would you fuck。

 who would you marry， who do you kill？Just something like that bang now it's you and the person conspiracy theories or hey let's pretend that you know we're you know we're related or something like that and then you're talking to someone saying you're related or hey if you just met the person's like tell your friends we actually know each other from high school hey this my friend from high school conspiracy theories only you and that person know the truth and you're in on it together。

Okay， conspiracy theories。Roole playing。Same thing。

Both of you doing a role play together that you're both in on。

And you would only also like the cool thing with the role playing is。

How to say it it allows you to also access。Different emotions and topics that you wouldn't be able to otherwise。

Right so here's， for example， a role play， especially if you want to go through getting a lot of emotions and display a lot of your personality。

You could say even if it's aum。Say we just take a business context right you're network networking with someone and you could literally joke it's like。

Oh man， you know， if we work together something something and then you can act it or like if like a what if situation and by doing the what if intro to it。

 you can then act in a way where you wouldn't otherwise because it's a what if situation future projections。

projectjections and stories of what you will do in the future。

That also gets people thinking outside of this one instance right and that we picture again you in more environments。

 oh me hanging out this person。you know out having coffee or oh going for a dinner oh or meeting their friends and going out together or something like that it's like oh this is what we're going to do in the future that also increases comfort and then lastly inside jokes right inside jokes jokes that's just the two of you all those things are huge in terms of building togetherness。
