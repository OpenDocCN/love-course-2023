# 朱利安《高频沟通》：1 介绍：1.3 情绪技能VS分析技能

What are emotional skills？This year。Is the inner work side of things。

It's called basically being yourself， right or being a natural， right， For example， state management。

Your state， how you feel that there is an emotional skill。 You're not going to solve that。

 thinking your way there。RightIf you had that experience or say， you know。

 you're walking down the street， you're like， oh， I really want to meet that person and you feel a little bit nervous。

 You're not in the zone。 You're kind of quiet。 You feel stifled。

 You can't think your way out of that that there， It's not a time and place to use analytical skills。

 That's where emotional skills come into play。 Okay， so state management。

 Being out of your head versus inside analyzing everything right， What should I say。

 What should I do， Am I saying the right thing， Oh， what about this， like。

 nope that's an emotional skill。Viibing， learning how to connect with people。

 learning how to just enjoy the experience of talking to people。 That's an emotional skill。

 How confident you are， How grounded you are。😊，Whether you're very reactive or not， being unreactive。

That's an emotional skill。Self amusement。Being in a collaborative frame as opposed to a competitive frame。

Right， for example， you could be in an environment。

 And if you assume everyone's your friend and on your side。

 it's very easy to relax and just let yourself shine， right， let your true self shine。😊。

That there is an emotional skill， not analytical。Playing to win， being unstifled。

Accurate social awareness。And this is where you also see that this has to come first。

 and we'll talk about this。 Don't worry， But if you don't work on the emotional skill side of things。

 you're not going to see reality for what it is， and you will not be able to pick up on the right patterns。

 not just that。 but say you're in your head。 You're analyzing everything， Second guessing everything。

 You don't even have enough mental bandwidth to start being aware of the experiences and references that you're getting。

Okay， but this here is 80% of it。Analytical skills。This would be， for example。

 as we talked about pattern recognition。Fra awareness。Just awareness of different dynamics going on。

Polishing your verbal skills。That's key， right， where， for example， even doing a speech like this。

 I could say a concept。 right， say I'm in the zone。 I'm feeling good， say a concept。 I'm like， oh。

 that was a great concept。 But then I could rewatch that speech or think about it and be like。

 you know what， it would actually be a little bit better。 if I said that concept this way。

 If I said this thing first。 And maybe if there was a joke out the joke there and tweak it around or expand that bit a bit that there is polishing。

😊，You could say the authenticity， the naturalness， right， If you think of being yourself。

 you can then polish it。 So you supercharge that authentic you。

But you have to have that authentic foundation first。Okay， so polishing your verbal skills。

 getting better social intuition。Getting a feel for what makes sense， what's right in this context。

 what isn't， what would be a relatable and what isn't。This is huge。

 and we're going to be talking about this。Two other big parts of social skills is learning how to tap into that authenticity and express it。

 But then also learning how to make it relatable and so that it connects with who you're talking to。

😊，If it doesn't connect with them， it doesn't matter if you're being authentic。

 that's not an interaction。That's not socializing。Okay。

 that will come a lot from the analytical skills。And of course， social calibration。

 part of connecting and making yourself relatable。But that's 20%。
