# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.4 一致性测试

There is this dynamic， called congruence testing。Where if a person cares and you hook them。

They are going to test you to make sure that you are who you present yourself to be。

When you have value， people are going to test you。Just remember that。This is good。

 People think it's bad。 They're testing me now。 This persons saying this That's good。

 They wouldn't test you if you didn't have value in their eyes。 They would dismiss you。

What it means is， oh， this person seems really cool。

Are they really who they present themselves to be if you are interviewing some？

And say you're interviewing someone for a crucial position in your life。Right。

 say it's you interviewing someone and that person is going to take over。I don't know。

Say you have kids it's going to take over your kids or say you have a business going to take over your business like something like just crucial you're like oh。

Are you going to do a five minute interview with that person and just listen to that person talk and take it at face value。

 yes or no？The answer is no。If the person goes up in the first five minutes， they're amazing。Great。

 but you're going to want more data right you're going to want to perhaps see how they react under different circumstances under different environments。

You're going to want to see how they react under pressure。Oh。Well。

 you just see someone like when it's a super chill environment， you're like， okay。

 you're hired or do you want to test them？You want to test them now if you test them though。

 this is the key， so a few things。You're only going to test someone where you see value in if you're doing an interview and you see someone who just sucks。

 you're going to be like， no， thank you next。You're not going to waste your time testing them because you see that yeah。

 they're already screwed。You're only get it to someone and you're like， wow。

 this person could actually be a perfect fit for this。Phase two。

 think of it as going to interview two， interview three。If you fail at interview one。

 that's terrible， you want to pass on to interview two and three and with each interview you're placed in different circumstances。

 there's different questions， a different vibe， a different attitude and different things are thrown at you。

That is great that's normal that's natural that's congruence testing and you say hi to someone' like oh yeah。

 this person might be cool， they'll test you。And they'll tells you in various ways and more often than not it's unconscious。

 they might test you in ways where they unconsciously just diminish the amount of chasing or approval。

Right where at first you might be telling some stories and like oh what what what and then at some point you say something and there's like h。

And they want to say， hey， how does this person react when I just look away a bit more？

Do they start chasing more or do they remain grounded？

How do they react if I ask them this if I challenge them a bit， if I throw this curve ball their way。

 what comes up， do they flinch they get stuck in their head？

How do they react when I put a joke when I put some pressure on them。

 how did they react when I introduce them my friends。

 how do they react when we move on this side of the venue？Is an example。So all of this is good。

Expect it and be happy when it happens。Okay。If it happens good， if it doesn't happen。

 it means you sucked。And what happens is people always think it's bad and they get stuck in their head and they freak out it's like no no no。

 this is great every single test is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your value for you to show that who you presented yourself to be is who you really are。

That's it， they're testing per roots， does this person being real or fake， that's it。

You only fail if you're being fake， if you're ground in authenticity， awesome。

And every time they throw it and you pass it。It's a great demonstration of value。It's a win。

 they're literally creating this opportunity for you to demonstrate your value。Now， of course。

 the foundation is the best way to pass the test is to remain unreactive。

Meaning you are who you presented yourself to be clarity of intent， nothing to hide。

And nothing throws you off because that's just you。

You're only thrown off if you're putting on a front。But as weve previously just discussed。

 this doesn't mean being unresponsive。If every time they conru test， you stop talking， you're like。

Unreactiveed no， you still got a talk， but they should sense。On the deeper layers。That you're good。

 congruence tend to be similar to one of those frame battles。 right， It's like， okay， let's。

 let's see。 is this person really that most important thing they're gonna to look for is emotional reactivity。

 If I flinch， if I'm like， like that， if I'm just。No， unaffected， good building on that foundation。

Okay， remaining。Unreactive， but yet responsive。Okay。

 there are a few ways that you can pass cogruence tests， right？

Simple congruence test is you say this to everyone。You go up and like， hey。

 nice to me is like so do you say this to everyone。

 so is this your thing do you say this to everyone？

That could be an example right now again what people assume is oh that's bad they think I say this to everyone versus now this is just a test someone testing just how to react to this a great opportunity with every test your answer is yes。

Yes says to everyone， you can answer it straightforwardly。Yeah， I do。

Or no I don't whatever the truth is， you don't have to overthink it as long as you just don't react right。

 but this is the difference， So did you say this to everyone。Yeah， yeah， I do， I do。You're done。

It has to be full on。It's thrown at you， there's zero flinching in your eyes。

And you really can't fake this， right， this is the power of honest signals， honest subcomications。

There can't be any flinching they can't see a shift in like so you say this to everyone and you're like。

 oh fuck in the subcommunications it's just purely like so you say this to everyone it's the same as if they told you。

Hey， he was like， oh， hey， be like， I like orange， Co me too。No shifting so you say this to everyone。

Yeah。So anyway， or so you say this to everyone？I actually don't， so anyway。Unwavering， unflinching。

Okay。You could also not answer at all。And just shift to a new topic or a new thread of conversation。

 act as if it's so far outside your reality， you can't even process it。

So it could be like so you sayist to everyone and it's just so weird that someone even asks you that that it doesn't register。

It's like so you say this to everyone and you're like。So anyway， as I was saying， keep it going。

All right， or you could challenge them back because like， wait what？No， anyways， as I was sayingane。

But again， the foundation is unwavering。Or。Answer the way you know they want you to。

 but out in condition。So you say this to everyone？How bad you want to know？So you。

 how bad do you want to know， there's a little hoop， there's a condition。

And now you reassert the frame。And reassert that you。Not shaken off。You could answer in a funny way。

 it's like no， only when I'm stuck in my head or doesn't have to make sense like no or yes。

 but did like something funny， right？And you could also misinterpret it like so that would be misinterpreting in a way that's funny right so it makes it seem like it's playing into your frame right playing into it being part of the plan like oh。

 thanks for setting up the next thing I was going to say thanks for setting up the next joke I was going to say。

Or misinterpretted is them complimenting you were trying to impress you what's a congruence test it really plays into a frame battle it's someone testing your frame testing the frame of the conversation testing the frame in terms of who you believe you are。

 how much value you have where you stand， who you are as a person and these are some other good ways。

To mess around with。Okay， that's really congruence testing， but expected to happen。

 expected it to happen throughout if it happens， great。

An opportunity for you to demonstrate that you are as valuable as you are that you are who you present yourself to be just a congruence testing in terms of like if you're in a group of people。

 let's say you having a conversation and there's a group of people listening in and then somebody interrupts and then everyone just starts laughing and you have no chance to kind of respond or react。

I've been in opportunity quite a few times， it's reduced as of late as I like go on。

 but it's something that I just don't know how to respond， but I just react to it I guess。

Thank you like so you're talking and someone comes in and does a joke where everyone laughs。

 but not you type thing like an inside joke yeah like a。哦。Yeah， a joke or。

A questioning the whole concept like a joke on what I'm talking about and then everyone just starts laughing straight of away and I'm like。

 I have no chance to like。Sha that unreactive but I am obviously reacting a little bit still so I like it。

 but give me more like give me one specific situation do you remember a specific situation。

 like one that comes to mind？😊，If not， create one that's as similar to what you've experienced while out。

啊， okay。So let's say I'm telling a story on letting go or I'm talking about something。

 one of the concepts in there and then there would some of in like oh always so spiritual or like type some type of silly joke and then you're like。

And then everyone's like that's not the issue， like them' just saying that。

 but the issue I find is when everyone just starts to laugh with that and then I'm like， oh， maybe。

Double， yes， awesome。 That's a great situation。 where you why do you like that situation。

 that's a chance to prove it to everyone。 Like， that's everyone testing you at the same time。

 That's the ultimate chance。 That's perfect。😊，Okay。

 but what happens to me is I would just lot along with it and then。I'll be like， it's fine don。

I don't know what to say that like， maybe I have two screws， oh， I guess I could just say that。😊。

I just be like， yeah， I totally am。 I love it。 I've been collecting crystals since I woulds， too。😊。

Some random thing like that。 It's the same thing is like unreactiveing and then just。😊。

Build on it like that's a perfect opportunity。 dude that happens to me all the time。

 Like dont think happens to me where' like， what you do or say a change， you know。😊。

Instagrams with someone and they're like， oh so you're like some self help spiritual coach。

 you don't think I'm going to get tested on that。 That's the first thing that happens。

So who are you to teach spirituality so teach me something？so what's your background also so go on。

 give me your best tip， give me some spiritual advice。First thing anyone says。Okay。

 great roll with it。It's like they would never do that， that thing。

 they would never do that to someone who they don't think has the potentiality of passing it。

And who has low value， meaning if you'd go in and you were such a loser in their eyes。

 they would never test you like that， they'd actually be very polite they'd be like， a this poor guy。

 they might either just be like hey， fuck off or they'd be like this poor guy look at him he's trying so hard with his spirituality。

 they won't fuck with them。They'd be like， oh， look at him。

 they would only do that someone who they think would take it， maybe to see if they would take it。

Right so be happy be like， oh yeah， and then you could literally play it along。啊。

Sharing the screen here again。The same thing here， right， you can answer straight and be like。

 oh yeah， totally am。And then just keep it going so anyway。😊，you get not answer it at all be like。

 oh， look is spiritual and be like， by the way， so keep it going。Right。

 answer the way you want to be like， could we so spiritual be like。

 do you really want to know how spiritual or like， can I tell you something。

 I don't know if I it's something like that， Okay what， You go， Mr her in a funny way。be like。

 we'll be what do you mean by spiritual what are you trying to say here， right， trying to step up。

 complimenting you be or exaggerated， if you' like， yeah， I totally am。You know。

 and then just be like， you know， my my home， I've like I've spent thousands on crystals and random stuff like that。

Right there's so many ways like all that is like and that's a good frame too it's like this is all material for you to be creative with and play to to to sculpt the interaction conversation。

 but that's also where it gets interesting that's where it gets spiced up and it's not so much this。

😊，You versus this battle， it's like the purpose of this type of teasing is to create some tension and some playful fun and banter and adds a ton of depth。

Um versus them just listening and having this logical back and forth about say spiritual letting go that's where it gets exciting so when that happens we be like。

Here we fucking go it's like you're fishing and bang the fish fucking bites Here we go。

 baby let's let's roll at this so celebrate it when it happens and then practice go with the flow and once more its that's the frame fun。

 that's the frame。Playful battle。And great opportunities to reassert your value。
