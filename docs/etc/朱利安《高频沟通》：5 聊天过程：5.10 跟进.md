# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.10 跟进

Following up， right， so say you've connected， you exchange all that。Great okay， stories too。

 by the way， you can use stories， especially with someone once you just。Friend and follow them。

You'll tend to pop up a lot more with your posts and your stories at least the next day or two right after。

Okay。How often should you post on Instagram？Honestly。

 that doesn't matter like like think of it like this like。

The the main resume will be done when they initially scroll through it and then whatever you post could be a reminder to scroll through it。

 but it's not about like then posting regularly it's just when they initially meet you and say click on it after what's there that's what matters more so you could literally from there just post。

Once a week， you can post once a month， it really doesn't matter as long as what's already there is what you want them to see。

Just make sure it's like the quality is the key here， not the quantity， just quality。

 like it's much better to have like only seven photos but that are the shit or videos and just convey all the different aspects versus a ton of stuff that doesn't do as much。

So minimum seven posts and then from there。Fill it up at whatever pace。

Works for you that doesn't decrease the quality， as I said。Make sure that there's the initial text。

Or a message that happens while you're still in person right even if you get a phone number。

 by the way， like if I get a phone number it's like immediately I text the person money。Immediately。

 right， so the first exchange always happens in person。From there when following up。

People often ask like how long should I wait it really doesn't matter right I mean you could say it does and you can calibrate after the fact but as long as the frame is set from the start and like oh this person's really cool it doesn't you don't have to wait a long time and actually the sooner you do follow up。

From a non needy frame， and again we're going to talk about all this。

 the better because you're still top of mind。Okay， that's really the key。

 the more time you spend where you aren't top of mind， the worse it gets。

And this is also why social media can actually help again， don't decrease quality。

 but say suddenly there's a story the next day that pops up now you're in their minded。

 now you're in their mind， always top of mind。Okay， I'll just top of my awareness but。From there。

 being clear in your intent， what does that mean？It means that wind following up。

There should be a reason。so say it's to meet the person again or it's to work together or accomplish X Yz。

 say that's your reason。Then that is going to determine。

How you follow up and what you do when following up where every single thing that happens when following up。

Has to be linked to moving things forward towards。That end goal。

 so say your intent is to meet the person again。Everything you text should in that case be moving things towards the media。

Never， ever just text for the sake of texting ever。And that screws so many people up。

 they'll text just for the sake of texting they'll text because they want a text back to feel a hit of validation like oh they text it back and that's just terrible anything you do on text。

 DMm， social media should always be purposeful and be moving things forward。

 be as straightforward as possible and only complicated if you have to。So say。I want to。

 I mean someone I want to hang out with them。Okay i'll message them so it already started say a message them my name or on social media and i'll still text my name or something it doesn't matter so there's the first text the next text will always be。

Say I want to have meet and hang out that night， hey， what are you doing tonight？

Straight up it's always a question， hey， what are you doing at this time or hey。

 what are you doing this day， hey， what are you doing Friday？Just clear in your intent， hey。

 I'm texting you to meet up。Okay， I'm not texting you to be your text brand or messaging you。

 I'm not doing it for the sake of doing it， I don't want validation， it's purpose driven。

So I don't even add a joke in there， I don't even say hey and this is the other one like people are like hey。

 you know I'm the person you met and you know we talked about this and we did this by the way。

 what are you doing and it's like just very try hard in my mind it's like I always assume right so assuming familiarity assume they already are hooked what would you text like what would you text a long termm friend you go hey what it's like hey what are you doing tonight hey hey what are you doing what are you doing Friday？

Just do that。And then。As we also previously discussed， calibrate after the fact。

So they might answer like， he wait who is this already so you didn't do the social media。

 who is this already， then you say， oh Julian。Right， but but I'm also just going to say Julian。

 I don't want to say Julian， you know we met the other day and did it I'm just Julian then if they asked wait what what Julian I'm like oh you know we met the other day we talked about that oh yeah。

But。😡，I'll calibrate after and wait for them to ask。

I always assume familiarity and just always clear and direct。And then you comp it if you have to。

 right maybe。They'll be like， oh， I'm free， let's do it and be like， oh， you know。

 I just can't and then you have to ask yourself， okay， if they can't， what perhaps is missing？

You know is there more value that needs to be injected here is more comfort right is there more personality and then you play off that and then I might add some joke。

 but then guess what say I do something funny like a joke。

That joke text is now no longer purposeless， it's purposeful i'm joking because it's a form of calibration after to inject a more personality。

 which may be needed。To then meet up。So never， ever just text to text。

 every text must have a reason must be purposeful。And then go from easy to complicated if you have to。

Don't just jump with a long essay。Okay， and when to meet the person， the sooner， the better。

But also you don't want to be texting too much， minimize time， spent messaging， texting， why？

This is another trap where people。They start texting and then they don't meet up very fast and a week passes。

 two week passes three weeks fast and they're still texting or they've just been texting nontop since。

And say you've been spending more time。Messaging， then in person。

 then there can actually be a form of resistance that forms in the other person and even a little bit of yourself in terms of meeting up。

Because you've gotten too used to the virtual dynamic， the virtual relationship。

Right so there's the real worldor connection relationship there's the virtual one spend too much time in the virtual people might not want to meet or spend as much time in the real world because they're afraid it might make it might be awkward because you're too used to the virtual or it might then ruin what you have virtually and then kind of make things awkward to the virtual thing where it continues so you want to really minimize it that's also why it's like I tend to do a lot shorter text straight to the point only to move things forward versus a lot of fluff and getting to know someone for example on text don't do that get them to know them in person in the real world。

Okay。Um， unless you have to， but in that case it's purpose full and you're still doing the bare minimum while moving things forward。

But always move things forward and in your text there too。

Show some humanity okay what does that mean it means don't try to be all perfect you're not writing some crazy essay don't be all you know grammatically correct with your points and stuff it's like make it human right it's like show the hey it's actually a person here。

And you can also use this to accentuate certain things。

So the first text I might send might be a little bit neutral。

 but then say you want to ask your question again， but a little bit more humph。

 you just don't add the interrogation point at the end。

Right so those there are like the shades of it's the range of expressive this and text so so you'll want to play around with that so say it's like hey。

 what are you doing tonight it's very different if there's an exclamation point or no。

They're both a question， but people will read it， and interpret it in a different way。yeah。

 we're more blaic， a little less try hard it's like， hey what are you doing tonight？

m so depending to and this is where you have to calibrate depending on the first interaction what's needed right if the person's like wow this person's amazing then you can go a little bit more oh you know expressive a little bit less nonchalant。

 but then maybe you'll need a bit more nonchalant you can also add。Emojis， right。

 I wouldn't do over the top complex ones。Do。Appropriate ones it also depends there on the context like if it's a business thing。

 I probably wouldn't unless I might do a thumbs up or the the O sign。

I might do that if it's someone i'm just connecting with for the fun of it， then I'll use。

The monkey with the eyes， I'll do that one。What other ones do I use， I'll check real fast。

But I'll do that one a lot， I'll sometimes do the punch one a lot。Praying hands a lot。

But basically have your go to， what you'll realize too is。And that can also be like we think， oh。

 it' it can be a little too low value if you do a ton of it， it can be。

 but used appropriately or just as a response， it can actually communicate a lot of value。Right。

 especially again like depending on a lot of this is really context driven like there can't be a one all end all。

 but if you look at a lot of people it's like there's so much value like the monkey with the hands。

Adds a bit of cute cockiness to someone who's already the shit with a ton of value it's like oh my gosh but then to someone being try hard it doesn't work so use that to your advantage。

 but it's okay to make some mistakes to not punctuate to add some emojis to be a bit more again show some personality human right it's not an email exchange it's not a professional exchange you're not writing an essay。

Keep it， keep it chill， flaking is normal， expect flaking， okay。

 why because people have things going on in their lives。Right。People are busy you know。

 and what we tend to do is we take it personally and people flake or when people can't expect people well one when you say。

 hey， let's hang out this time and day。Play for the wind but the majority of people won't be able to you'll have to ask again maybe two three times so just wash rinse repeat right just ask yourself what's missing maybe it's a context thing maybe they're just busy maybe there's needs to do more value more comfort so on and so forth then ask again but just always keep moving these forward and then even flaking like oh yes let's do it and then maybe the day of or day foil I can't that's normal too wash rinse repeat it's normal and I would actually expect it a lot because hey people are busy things come up。

People also get perhaps scared or shy or whatnotds around meeting people publicly。You know， socially。

 so don't take the person。Okay， and don't let it affect you with the freedom from the outcome it's like。

 okay， all good， never show any reactiveness， never show that it's a huge deal like wait what you said this？

Just washher and repeat and then of course always follow up keep following up if you write them like we out and they say sorry I can。

Like what to do next like do just like oh okay， here's that joke or do wait some time and then try to add value or how that depends right like again this is the other one here There is no cookie cutter。

Thing that you just do like you can't just do it then I press this button it depends on the situation right Maybe you got ask yourself。

Because what'll determine number one， how willing they are to hang out with you。

 why they can or can't， maybe they just can't because they're busy and be like， I have no worries。

Right， and then just text another day， hey， what are you in this day？I had to be like， okay。

 no worries， what are you doing this day？And just ask for another time maybe you realize oh there probably they might be saying no because there hasn't been enough personality conveyed in which case then you can be like no worries and then text them something that conveys personality so it really depends on the situation like that there you're going to have to start testing and trying different things and。

Analyzing the previous interaction analyzing what was conveyed what might be missing based upon how they text their tone。

 what you can read from the text exchange， all those things those variables play into what should be done so at that point you're going to have to like test and try and see。

I wish there was a cookie e cuty one， though。But yeah， but big the most important principle though。

 is。Keep going as if all is good don't show any reactiveness， don't be butt hurt。

 don't be like you should respect my time， don't do any of that and really take on the frame with the free from the outcome like。

You know， say they can't what would someone like say you don't truly feel it， ask yourself。

 what would someone text back and how would they react and how would they feel if they already have a million amazing things going on like say you got a million things going on and if suddenly they can't you have all those things to go to how would you react。

 how would you text from that mindset from that frame then text back like that person would be like。

 oh， it's so buffer her they' be like no worries。Oh we'll hang another time and then another time you'll just wash and repeat it so my question is about。

Following up when somebody doesn't respond or doesn't reply to you。

Like say you take the straightforward approach like hey it's good to meet you。

 what are you doing on Friday and then they they don't reply。有啊。

Its so where you're maybe like calibrating to insert some value after that like a I don't know a joke or something or I would do actuallyum。

Depending on when you ask for it， so if you're like， hey， what are you doing？

Like say it's Saturday now and you're asking like， Monday， hey。

 what are you doing Monday and say there's no answer？U，Then I would wait till Sunday or Monday。

 and then I would text two question marks。If it's like， hey。

 what are you doing tonight and say right now， it's like， you know， say 11，50 a， what hey。

 what are you doing tonight？And I don't hear anything then this afternoon I'll text two question marks。

 but it's the the first follow up if there's no answer for me is always。

 and I love you as this two question marks。Now， this could also be viewed as like needy。

 like give me the answer what， But once more， this is also why it's so important to really show who you are at first where it's like。

 no， no， this is me just。Going for what I want， hey， answer， like yes， no， what's going on like just。

Being more straightforward and leading and assertive， so I'll do that。

And usually that'll get some answer， maybe like， oh yeah。

 sorry forgot God or oh like a reminder because people forget right。

 you'll check and then you'll literally forget so I'll do that。And if that doesn't get an answer。

Then I will just not text right ignore just keep again。

 what would someone who's living their best life do and then I would wash rinse repeat after the fact but I'd switch up the approach right so say right now it's Saturday right Saturday 1152 hey。

 what are you doing tonight no answer。Later on this afternoon， two question marks， still no answer。

Then nothing enjoy my night， and then I'll probably wait till。

Depending again on how that first interaction went it might be tomorrow。

 but probably I'd wait the next day and then I might try a different approach and suggest a new plan washs repeat right so that let's go again so hey you know if there is no answer what could be missing maybe more personality maybe even some more value so I'd be like hey。

m，You know， I'm doing this， I would suggest like he I'm doing this。Dot dot dot， dot dot value insert。

 and then I would reuggest to meet up like let me know if you want to join。All so it's like， hey。

 you know I'm going to be out Thursday， got this， you could say bullet for you right like hey I'm doing this this music thing I'm out Thursday you should swing by it would be fun。

All right， some more。Meet and then go from there and then if there is still no answer to that。

Then that would be one where you might want to wait some time。

 see if you can convey some stuff for social media or it'd be one where you might just wash and repeat like a week or a month later and see。

嗯。Right or worst case just call because that too even on the phone。

 you'll be able to convey a lot more of your personality calling so you could try calling like if there is no answer there。

 you could try calling。The day that you suggested， like say， oh， Thursday， right。

 there's this thing going off music， you should swing by。Then no answer， no answer， Thursday。

 like right before or during then call and be like， hey。

 where are you at and then try to get something going on the phone？Okay。Yeah。

 that makes sense that makes sense I think I think a little bit prior So prior to this I had done maybe too much of the just like chatting via message to like you know like get oh gotta get the conversation going first and so yeah straight for the meetup the less time between meetup one meet up to the better yeah so I see that now and I'm just thinking about like like you said maximizing the numbers in the context I already have so like maybe maybe going back to some of those conversations that have died and possibly just just jumping straight to like the hey。

 what are you doing tonight or whatever1 that's what I would do just go back hey what are you doing tonight and then calibrate from there right even a response like wait who is this already then you know hey it's me or even just might even if it's an old number just call。

Right， and then also to if you want how to say the default if someone。

Forgot who you are or it didn't save your number or whatnot and you call the default is you're going to go to voicemail no like people rarely answer a number of the calls。

But here's the key call twice back to back， they'll answer on the second time most of the time。

Right because everyone checks it's like who the fucks this you don't answer and you're gonna see are they going leave a voicemail but say they call again you're like oh is this an emergencynce or something and then we tend to answer so do the two call formula say right now you suggest to meet up next next Friday right or next Thursday so hey。

 let's meet up next Thursday and it's Saturday now that's a lot of time and say they agree hey sure that's awesome。

Great， but that's a lot of time between now and Thursday and if they just kind of forget about it and stuff then it'll be it just won't work right so you'll want to do perhaps some text in between or some kind of social media so that you do pop up in their mind。

Ideally。Once a day or every two days。Right I wouldn't necessarily do every every day like maybe every day like back to back and then wait two days。

 but like kind of alternate one day to two days on average just to re pop up and that that would be again purposeful because now you're doing it to stay top of mind and that's where you could do something like。

You know， fun text， hey check this out or conveying value like hey just finished。

 you know this song let me know like check it out let me know if you you know check this out or like what what are your thoughts on this just finished it bang here's a song like stuff like that just like oh top of mind top of mind and then actually one more thing you can do on the more technical side on the day of right so say they agree and it's like we're meeting Thursday and say Thursday hits。

What I personally always do is。You know， text that day， like say it at night。

 I would text at some point that day， maybe in the afternoon， hey， by the way， just a heads up。

'm I'm going to be running 10 minutes like let's is it cool if we meet at whatever time you said。

 but plus 10 minutes？And then this is a good way to one remind them to reconfirm that it's on you can also ask like we still good for tonight but that is a little bit too like hey are we still good and it's kind of just asking do you not want to so so I like saying stuff like hey we are still good but here's a small change。

Like it's a good way to just kind of casually remind the person and it also gives the person。

If they do want the out to flake so you don't actually show up and say waste your time too it's like。

 oh， I completely forgot actually I can do tonight and they you're like， oh all good。

 all good wash's repeat， but I like doing that just at some point before， hey。

 I'm gonna be running 1 you know 5，10 minutes late。

 is it cool if for you meet at whatever original time plus 10 minutes。😊。

It makes sense I like the idea of sending them like something i'm working on to but specifically from the check this out frame because you know like musicians or people can be like oh hey like is this good does this sound good but if you like I'm from the like check this out frame I like that a lot I like I like doing that as well that。

Oh yeah， sounds good。Thank you When it comes to like posting content。

 I always sort of wonder because now a lot of these social media platforms have a lot of different kind of avenues。

 you know they've got like reels they've got the actual post posts where you can post video。

 they've got your stories which is again video again and the thing that kind of confuses me about it is you've got the same medium like photo and video or you've got all these different kind of channels to post it in and I'll you if you give thoughts I mean if anyone else wants to message me or like hit me up on Facebook Ill be happy to get some feedback on this。

 but I just I could never quite figure out exactly。Where to post what。

 if there's like a general rule， if there's like a way of doing that。

 what do you sort of thoughts of？If you're not planning on really posting a ton and dedicating a lot of time and energy towards your social media。

 meaning if you're not going be posting weekly and always new stuff。

 you don't want to use all the mediums because only someone who is you could say an Instagram you know her would use all creative Yeah so if you're just a regular person you're using all that it can actually and especially if you don't have tons of posts or you're not posting that much it can look a little weird right it's like something's a bit off so。

The bare minimum， like if what I would do because for me， to be honest， if it wasn't for work。

I'm not a big social media poster guy right like even a lot of stuff I post for work it's like clip cuts or photos not and even stories I don't even I should be doing more stories I'm just not that like but my default wouldn't be like let's go on social media and post all this so my default like if I didn't have the work at all is I'd have those seven basic photos and I would only do photos。

And then it's also playing on your unless it's playing on your strengths。

 unless you have a really cool。I'll correct that I would do majority photos and then I would select some specific videos not so much like oh me talking into it or anything like that。

 but like of something cool right so maybe there's a video of me when I was younger playing guitar right like a little thing on stage playing guitar I would do that little clip and do like a callback where it shows personality vulnerability and oh something artistic guitar so I would do that so then I would use the video but then for the most part it would just be really good photos that convey different sides of who I am and then I just wouldn't post that much and especially if you don't have many followers you could even argue it's better to not have that many posts because someone without many followers。

The the rationale is you're not a big social media person。

 but then if they see your your page is just a ton， you're like wait a minute。

 you have all that fucking content you them would there's like a window there yeah。So。So yeah。

 there are all those factors there， so I'd say it's asking yourself overall like。

Again people besides like what what would you like doing just for the sake of doing it or you someone who does want to post a lot like I know people they just love it that' just who they are do you want to dedicate a ton of time to it do you want to get tons of followers on there in which case。

Then go all out， but otherwise。Go out to the extent you're comfortable with。

 but maybe not too much and just bare minimums fine I wouldn I wouldn't explore all those features and putting all these hashtags or whatnot I would just keep it very simple and minimal。

I guess yeah， I guess that makes sense it's just it's confusing to me sometimes like if I go out to like a bar or something and I'm having an awesome night like sometimes I like to shoot like my story right and again I'm not obviously going do that。

😡，Yeah， I'm not a big social media person， but then sometimes I look at， you know。

 other people on Instagram and they'll post a similar video or something that's happened like during a festival and it's actually in the post。

And so that would gets me like going， well， how does somebody make the decision whether to？

You shoothoot a video in a post shoot in a story that's the pot that i'm always just like you know post is permanent so think of the post as being something that really has a lot of value to you so if someone say you don't have many posts and you post a video of say you all out it means that that time you were having out was really important to you。

Um， whichch？It might have been some epic party that you're at in which case you could make the post。

 but if it's just a regular night out， it could actually subcommunicate low value because it's like。

 oh， just a regular night out such a big deal for this guy that he made a fucking post about it。

Right versus oh just a night out right， oh， like this is a big deal for him so it has to。

Generally be impressive， Otherwise it'll hurt you unless。You have fuck tons of posts。

So that's for someone who has very little posts， like the less amount of posts， the more important。

 the more value is attribute to each one， so if you have a ton then you could slice it in。

 but then you got to keep that consistency and have the amount of followers。

 likes and comments that justify the massive amounts of content you post on there。

It's very confused man I like this's just so much in you it's like， you know。

 if you post the line you got to have the followers and the oh my God this why I don't this is why I haven't engaged in the first place all right go damn。

😊，But that's why I get， I do like the minimalist approach the best personally unless you really want to immerse yourself in that world。

 then you'll get a feel for all that， but otherwise。Just do the minimalist and in that case。

 think whatever those main posts are there's going to be a lot of value attributed to each one is my add out that valuable probably not。

Yeah， gotcha， make it cool， keep it simple， make it cool， got it。
