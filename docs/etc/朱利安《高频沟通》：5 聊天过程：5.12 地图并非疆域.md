# 朱利安《高频沟通》：5 聊天过程：5.12 地图并非疆域

Mindsets's when going out。And this is all very key okay give up on this idea of having a perfect interaction you know or conditioned that way you might even go through some of the ideas here and start thinking if that things will fall according to plan。

 you know you have all your ducks in a row it's like well first of all say this and then that person will say this and then I'll read their social cues and I'll do this and the behavioral cues。

Sure， okay， that's the map， but the map， of course。

 is never the territory and every single interaction is going to be messy。

Every single interaction at some point or at many points is going to go not according to plan。😊。

And this freaks people out right where they can't adapt to reality， they value the model。

 which is what we're breaking down here right this is a conceptual model。

 they value that they value the map over real life。

 don't make that mistake real life that information you're getting in front of you trust that over any kind of theory concept idea。

 mental map， mental model， you name it， enjoy times where it doesn't go according to plan。

RightIt's great to have very accurate， you could say anticipated。You know， skills。

 right anticipative skills where， for example， when I talk to someone。

 I can read them being modest very fast， which allows me to then connect with them on a much deeper and authentic level。

But then I also am able to really anticipate a lot of what they're going to do or say or the direction the whole interaction is going to go in。

 and this allows me once more to make it a lot more win win。However。

 if suddenly they veer off from what I anticipate from the mental model。

 I will always adapt to reality and I will enjoy that okay it adds that unpredictability。

 it adds a bit of that you know spark to an interaction you're like wow。

 this is new right if everything thing went according to plan they'd be very boring okay so give up on that idea of a perfect interaction messiness is good okay socializing is messsy there's gonna be kples thrown at you left and right you think everything will be fine suddenly someone else comes in you're talking this person things will go according to plan you say the wrong thing they say the wrong thing just it's this whole mess and you could say someone who's really good socially a social master is someone who's。

Able to stay very grounded。And okay in that chaos right it's a positive chaos where two entities who are different are trying to find common ground and mesh and connect together on different topics or wavelengths or emotions you name it of course it's going to be messy。

And that's what makes it so exciting and so fun， so embrace that okay。

 don't sweat the small stuff don't get too anal right with a lot of these ideas that we've covered。

I know you might be like， well， I can never break this rule。Nothing that we covered is a rule， okay。

 even though it might say rule， sometimes it's not a rule， it's simply guidelines。

Right you're going to break every single one of these guidelines don't sweat the small stuff okay again that's the whole part of socializing being messy you should be making mistakes you should be forgetting about different things you should be doing stuff that you were taught the opposite that's part of it all okay and lastly of course learn to roll with the punches that's the skill the person who can remain the most chill。

Who has the most references which we're going to cover here， who can anticipate the best。

 but ultimately that just rolls with the punches。That social skills it's not making reality fit to your map it's using the map to connect with reality on a much deeper and more authentic level。
