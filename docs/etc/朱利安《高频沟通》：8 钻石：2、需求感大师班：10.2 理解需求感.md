# 朱利安《高频沟通》：8 钻石：2、需求感大师班：10.2 理解需求感

Needinginess as a vibe is extremely repelling it's one of the most repelling vibes out there right and we as humans have a very fine tuneed you could say social radar for it where unconsciously we're always pinging right what's the vibe what's the vibe and we will pick up on this extremely fast okay。

 the same way where say you're sitting next to someone。

Even a stranger you can be sitting there someone say I don't on a plane or something and you sense the person's stressed right they don't have to tell you that they're stressed you're just going to get that energy off of them and be like stressed the same with neediness right you could just sense if someone is really needy and clinging and our immediate response is like like we treat it like some kind of toxic just this Bible will kill me if I'm around it too long avoid avoid at all costs okay it is extremely repelling as soon as need kicks in。

You're done right it's to that point too as you know from the course itself where we hear this term might offer value。

 offer value it's reached a point where people are so needy that the simple act of you know what I call eliminating the downside just not taking value just not being needy you don't even have to give any value just don't take just that puts you massively above most of the population right it's like whoa this person's okay they're not providing a ton but they're not taking that's how low the bar is and ultimately how needy people are okay so do understand it it's like there's a repelling vibe on your end do learn to also。

Pick up on it in others right it's like you should be able to not just unconsciously because that's what we'll it's like oh I feel the neediness。

 but people don't realize that they're picking up on it they'll be like I just don't like that person oh that person's weird to try hard it's like can you pick up on subtle layers even within an interaction can you pick up on moments where perhaps someone turns into a little phase of neediness for like say two minutes and then snaps out of it okay this is a dynamic a feel this comes before four words it again the emotional vibe start recognizing neediness in others okay when it shifts especially away from playing to win intention to desire craving and desperation。

With neediness as well。In terms of understanding it and identifying it within others and yourself by the way。

 there tends to be a massive fixation with the physical right it's like all about you know the having right it's like I need to get this I will feel better and feel more confident when this is a common one I get a new phone right like why is it that people just buy phone after phone after phone。

 there's two reasons， especially when it comes to say Apple I know a lot of people every single year they buy the new phone。

Especially and this is what you got to think about especially when there's almost no changes right it's like every year it's like it's the same phone but the camera is a little better right the human eye won't really notice it unless you do massive photographic editing and Photoshop and whatnot but that's why you buy and people just chase and chase and chase which is。

Insane。Right， now why will they buy it reason number one？Is that after a year？

Your phone will actually get slower because Apple slows it down as the joke answer。

 but also somewhat real。I think they were actually sued for it and came out and apologized years ago。

 like， we'll stop， but did they really stop？Reason number two is people buy that new phone to feel enhanced right there's all the hype around it they believe it's also a sign of just status of having the new latest gadget and do they buy it for the practicality do they buy it like oh I'll be able to text oh yeah no because you can do that for your old phone I'll be able to take the picture you can do it for your old phone the only reason you buy it is there's that need around it and you believe that once you have it you will be an enhanced person。

That phone will enhance your self worth， that's what you believe exactly right I can get status from it 100%。

And as soon as you find out about it， this is what's crazy。Half of you gets really excited。

 like say right now， Apple announces new phone， right， play this mental game with me， say right now。

As you're hearing my voice， you get a little notification。 It's like， hey。

 there's been an Apple event。 They announced the new phone， the new phone's epic。

 it folds in half and bh b， b， b， b。😊，Guaranteed half of you at that point is gonna be super excited。

 Oh， I can't wait。 That's the missing piece。 That's what neediness also does。

 It just always keeps it out of reach。 right It's like， oh， it's this。 It's this。 It's this。

 almost a little bit more。 It seem to be like， that's the missing piece。 But then it simultaneously。

 It will also bring up into your awareness。 how you don't feel complete right now。 It's like。

 I didn't know that I needed this。 But now that I know I do need this。

 And I don't feel good enough until I have it。😊，It kind of pokes at this little void within where you're like。

 well， now there's a void that needs to be filled by a new phone。

And people just keep chasing again the physical。You might think that the answer to all your problems is you know。

 having a better dating life， having a better friendship life， having more money， so on and so forth。

 it's like just kind of audit where your mind goes， it's like hey。

 what's the solution if it's immediately physical， physical， physical， physical lot of neediness。

Okay， now。Needy people cannot be trusted， this is something just in terms of understanding neediness that is key why。

 because neediness makes you inauthentic and manipulative。Now you might think here this。

 well that's all true I'm needy sometimes but I'm a good person I don't manipulate well it doesn't always happen consciously for the most part it is unconsciously out of your awareness okay so。

Here is a classic example and also huge in terms of the conditioning right we are conditioned to believe that for example。

 we there's a soul mate out there for every single one of us。😊。

And we are conditioned to believe that when we find that that perfect soulmate that partner。

 we will be whole， it's like two halves coming together and now we're this whole you know person or be。

And although that sounds beautiful and there's great movies made around it where you watch it you're like。

 yes， now they're together in they're whole and it's happy ending and lived happily ever after in reality。

 if you analyze the dynamic there it is very toxic because what is it saying that you are not good enough without your partner and vice versa？

So let's just say that you are to find that soulmate and you are to get into a relationship right if you look at the you know we hear they lived happily ever after well did they really let's look beyond the scene here what really happened after that what happened after that is massive fear of loss and manipulation。

That's what happened because say right now it's like， I'm a half。

 they're a half together we're whole， are you going to want to lose your other half？

Now as soon as you're together immediately it's like well what if they leave me then I'm back to be in a half so you're gonna do whatever it takes to keep your other half there and that leads to again more often than not it's unconscious but manipulation power plays right how do I keep my partner attracted to me so on and so forth your partner doing it as well it's like this entanglement of neediness man and also someone who's very needy will be less inclined to be authentic because they will be this kind of social chameleon just presenting whatever they believe will get them that outcome okay so as soon as this is important to understand people sense neediness it's repelling and the label that we associate is like needy people in authentic this person is definitely not being real because they need something from me and they are being manipulative right even in the inauic side that is a form of being manipulative right I'm going to present this to get the certain outcome terrible okay？

So understand that。Needinginess is also a sign of low self worth not being deserving it's a very low value tell right it's like whoa right like think of it like this too is's like you。

When you you talk to someone where。You could say it feels like you're in the same league as them or you're even outside their league。

 whatever that means right or you feel just very deserving to talk to that person。

There is no neediness。Right if you talk to a person where it's like in your mind it makes sense makes sense to talk this person。

 it makes sense， of course they would listen to me I feel very deserving right the same day around maybe certain family members you're like what's my family right if you you sit down with your family's like of course if feel deserving to be here。

If you didn't and in situations where you don't， that's where neediness activates right when suddenly feels like you're kind of batting outside your league。

 neediness， I don't feel deserving kicks in and that signals to everyone。 whoa。

 this person's self worth is lower， they don't feel deserving to be here low value， inauthentic。

 manipulative， repelling。Done。Okay， so it does signal that it means wow， this person has low value。

They really do feel enhanced by being here， talking to us， talking to me， they really need it。

Why would I associate with that person？Okay。And ultimately it comes from this self generated lack within。

This is huge right and we'll talk about it where what we do is you can say you're born a whole。

As you know。And through your conditioning， we all form this split with it。All right。

 there's that split。And we ultimately generate this lack within this artificial lack。

 we tell ourselves， I'm not good enough as I am。I had have these good parts of me。

 these unacceptable parts of me and that's that's bad I wish it was all good。

 so I'm going to try to compensate externally so we create this lack and then we try to fill that void externally。

And that's what it also signals， it's like， wow， this person really has a big void within they've created a lot of lack within that they're trying to fill with whatever it is that they need。

Okay， we are conditioned to need approval。Approval for us really tends to be again。

 due to our conditioning the equivalent of oxygen， okay why if you rewind back to say childhood？

you're born， you come into this world， of course you're going to depend on approval for survival right based upon your perception。

 can you fend for yourself， no you're a kid， you need whoever is raising you to take care of you to protect you to provide for you。

Right， now what happens if you see the person who's raising you。

 your parents or whoever raised you right， your primary caretaker， say the word to disapprove of you。

Even though for the most part again it's meant to help you。

 we can interpret that as they don't love me right now they're they're saying no。

 don't do that right don't touch the stove， they don't love me。What happens if they don't love you。

 they could abandon you， what happens if they abandon you。

 you die because you can't fend for yourself。So from a young age we really make that association like approval equals survival。

 I must get approval from whoever's raising me or I am screwed。However。That isn't true。

Right just because you could say whoever's raising you like see your parents like no。

 no no doesn't mean they're going to abandon you and let you die。

 but based upon our limited perception as a child we do believe that and that tends to still run us into our adult life and that of course is something to let go of okay approval is not oxygen。

You don't need it to survive， you don't need it to breathe that kind of unrealistic relationship you have with it is something too sever。

Okay， now this doesn't mean don't play to win and say get approval right if you don't get much approval in life。

 you are going to be very limited there's not going to be many options available to you there's not going to be many doors that are open right like approval and is really the the currency of working in a society working with others so still aim to get approval i've seen people fall into the trap but they're like scrutiinnyiness I don't need anyone's approval。

And then they just go crazy and calibrated and they're like， I don't care。

 I don't need their approval， Scew everyone else。 That's really bad。 You should still again。

 depending where your goals are too， like say here's a certain goal you're gonna have to have X amount of approval to accomplish that goal So definitely still aim to get approval you're not letting go of approval completely what you're letting go of is the need for it once more it's not the thing it's the place it's coming from You are letting go of that unrealistic craving where it's like I need approval or I'm going to die right it's not。

 you could say a choice。 It's a reflex。 So it's's it's forced versus。I don't need it。

But my intention is to still have it。Huge， okay， it's the same as say someone who may walk into a venue。

And by default， they get very stifled， very shy because let's just say they fear the disapproval and again they're craving the approval。

 so they walk in and they have no choice， no control it's like stifled quiet。

As someone who let go of the need for approval， you might walk in that venue。

And looking at the environment and the people， you might decide that the most appropriate course of action that is still authentic to you is to perhaps be a little bit more quiet。

But here's the thing。 you notice it， and you choose。To act in a quiet way。

 You choose that method of expression versus someone who's still run by it。 They don't have a choice。

 They're stifled。So that's really the shift it's not screw all approval getting naked effort no。

 it's I'm aware， but unlike someone who immediately gets triggered and again。

 the approval is controlling them I will choose if I want to to act in an appropriate way that will gain me approval so you still need approval but approval is not oxygen it's not the thing it's the place it's coming from and ultimately reaching a point here of no neediness right is reaching a point where you dissolved thats split within that's what's that the cost。

Okay， you'll hear a lot of advice when it comes to neediness there are also a lot of amazing external tools。

 but if you really want to get to the cause and nip it in the bud。

 it comes down to dissolving that split that we create within ourselves there here's the acceptable me here's the unacceptable me it's letting go and this is why honestly inner work is so key right you heard me talk about this too in the last masterclass right social anxiety where I said focus on macro concepts instead of micro concepts。

Right huge instead of focusing on little on all the little details so people do is they're like oh I'm neediness。

 how do I battle neediness and you can focus on all these microcons grades or you can just start dissolving that split within through the inner work and it takes care of the rest you want to look at those few things where the ripple effect takes care of all of the other little things。

😊，And again， you dissolve that split， there's no longer that self generated lack。

 there's no longer that， you know what， that that void within to fill。You feel very deserving。

And it's easy， and it just clicks。Okay， so in terms of understanding neediness， this is how， again。

 people experience it， see it， what it signals。 And when it comes to the work that we're doing here。

 it's not letting go of approval。 It's letting go of the need。For approval。
