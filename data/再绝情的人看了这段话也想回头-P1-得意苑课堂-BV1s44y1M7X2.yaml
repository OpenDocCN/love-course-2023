  text: '# 再绝情的人看了这段话也想回头 - P1 - 得意苑课堂 - BV1s44y1M7X2再绝情的人看了这段话也想回头，没有彻底死心的前任只有放弃复合的你，一段感情只要还有一个人坚持就不会结束，而这段话呢再绝情的前任看了都会想回头，例如如下，我不能一直卑微地求着你回来。你是我这辈子最想拥有的人，也是我最不想放弃的人，我曾经向所有人炫耀过你炫耀过我们的爱情，可现在的我呢却要瞒着所有人，只敢偷偷地继续爱着你，不纠缠的道理我听了无数遍，可是面对你的时候我真的做不到。也许你觉得累了就要放手，不爱了就要分开，也许我们终究还是不能在一起，但是也别辜负了我们相识相知相爱，人生只要两次幸运就好，一次遇见你一次陪你走到底，回来吧我在原地等你，发完之后就别联系了。给对方一点考虑的空间和时间，他会主动找你的。'
