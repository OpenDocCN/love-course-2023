    and this is one that gets focused on a lot by the mainstream。and not focused on
    at all by PickUp， and it should be focused on a little bit， because it matters。。Okay？
    So， do you think that if a girl asks what you do for a living， and your answer
    is， like。filing clerk or doctor， do you think it makes a difference in her eyes？，Often
    times yes。 Okay。let''s be honest， it does。 Now， that doesn''t mean you have to
    get a new job to do PickUp， right？。Doesn''t mean it''s that important， but it
    does make a difference。 Iconography matters， right？。Or if a girl has grown up
    in a certain， like， social environment， like maybe she grew up in， like。at a yacht
    club or something like that， and you''re dressed in the way that''s congruent
    with the environment she grew up in。do you think that makes a difference？，Yeah，
    it helps。 It helps。 Okay？ So。iconography is basically this idea that a girl has
    an idea in her head of the type of guy that she would date or that she would marry
    or that she would sleep with。and if you fit that image， everything''s gonna be
    easier。，If you don''t fit that image。it doesn''t mean you can''t succeed， but
    it is way， way， way tougher， right？ Why？Because you''re fighting the ideas in
    her head。 You''re also fighting probably her friends who have similar ideas in
    her head who will be。have bigger objections to you， right？，Let''s say， for example，
    there''s the girl that， like。'

  text: take the yacht club girl that I just mentioned， and you seem like， kind of
    like a thuggish。biker-y type of a guy， right？ And let's say you're talking to
    her and she really likes you。 Great。Now let's say her friends look over and see
    that happening。 And let's say she's not drunk。but she has had drinks。 What are
    they gonna assume？，"Oh， God。 Mary's fucking wasted。Look at who she's with。 We
    better go save her。" Right？ It matters。 It factors in， okay？ So。the thing I want
    to tell you guys here， 'cause a lot of the pickup doctrine is looks don't matter。it's
    all about your subcommunication。 Yeah， but no， right？，Yeah， but this stuff does
    matter， too。Yeah， but it's gonna help turn attraction into a result。 Yeah。but
    it's gonna help you be perceived well by her friends and give you more time to
    work。 Yeah。but it's gonna have her friends allow you to take her home。whereas
    otherwise you'd end up getting a number。 So， these things definitely do matter，
    okay？。It definitely do matter。 The other thing it will do is。regardless of how
    good your subcommunication is， if you walk up with the right look。you're gonna
    get a window of opportunity to convey your personality。If you walk up with the
    wrong look， you're gonna get a "eh" or like some really hard shit test instead。okay？
    And that makes a difference。 'Cause how many of you， when the interaction starts
    well。do better？ Yeah？ How many of you， when the interaction starts terribly， do
    worse？ Yeah。，So。

  text: you might wanna think about your look and you might wanna think about， A。what
    you can do to like convey an iconography that's attractive to women in general，
    and B。specifically for the type of girls you want， what is their iconography and
    can you fit it in a congruent way。right？ And to the extent that you can， you should。
    Does that make sense？ 'Cause it matters， alright？。
