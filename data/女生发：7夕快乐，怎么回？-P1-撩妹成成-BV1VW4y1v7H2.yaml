    such a name，I won''t see you tonight so I can keep from going insane。But I don''t
    know enough，I get some kind of lazy day。I''ve been fagging this through to find
    my title name。I''ll be stooped and bowed but I''ll leave us both the same，But
    I don''t know enough。I get some kind of lazy day，''Cause it''s hard for me to
    lose in my life，I found only time will tell。And I will figure out that we can
    be better，We can do to understand， yeah。And it''s hard for me to lose in my life，I
    found outside your skin right near the fire。That we can be better，We can change
    and be alright，I''m a little used to wandering outside your brain。You can leave
    me tomorrow if it suits you just the same，But I don''t know enough。I need sun
    when it leaves the day， yeah，''Cause it''s hard for me to lose in my life。I found
    only time will tell，And I will figure out that we can be better，We can do to understand。yeah，And
    it''s hard for me to lose in my life，I found outside your skin right near the
    fire。That we can be better，We can change and be alright，Zither Harp，了解更多，敲讚一下！。'
