    high school， then they go to college， they are very good in college。they nail
    their damn grades， they do their studying。they get their A''s and they ace their
    LSAT so they are smart too。。Then they go off to do their articling and they are
    really really good at it。。And then they get offered an associate position and
    they are really really good at it。。And then by the time they are 30 they make
    partner and let''s say they are in high pressure。high paying jobs。，$250，000 a
    year， $300，000 a year， $500 an hour。，Okay， what''s your life like？。You work all

    that has any sense at all knows that''s complete bloody rubbish。，It''s market

    30s？。They all leave the high end law firms。，Why？，Why？，Cause who in their right
    mind would wanna live like that？。'
