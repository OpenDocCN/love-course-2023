    income etc experience that takes time。man is 35 is not the same as a woman is
    35 at all，so many sugar daddies man。as a men age like wine women typically age
    like milk。now can you push the clock back a little bit as a woman you go to the
    gym you take care of yourself do some kegels whatever yeah for sure。but you never
    gonna be able to compete with your 21 year old self when you are 31 bro，period。the
    other things too from a biological perspective most of your eggs are gone by the
    time you are 35。consider a high risk pregnancy，and by the time you are 30 like
    80% of your eggs plus are gone。so if a man wants to have a family you can''t even
    give him children。you are virtually useless from a biological standpoint，that''s
    the truth，that is the truth。that''s facts from a biological standpoint，if I wanna
    have a family and I am marrying a chick that is 35 years old。there is a higher
    than 90% chance that I will not be able to have children with her。I know a couple
    right，I know a couple that are deeply in love，he loved her she loved him。she was
    35 and he was like 42，and what happened was he was trying to have kids for like
    years。and he just said to her one day he was like yo you know what I love you
    but I want kids and you can''t give that to me。and he left and I was sad because
    like they really loved each other。and that''s the biggest honor that you can bestow
    upon a man is children and a family。'
