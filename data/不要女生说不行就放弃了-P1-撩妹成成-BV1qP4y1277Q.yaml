    去往吧 前台，回憶裂掉 也沒人在，就像我的思緒 越思考越混亂，我又多遮掩 去往吧 前台，回憶裂掉 也沒人在。就像我的思緒 越思考越混亂，我叫自己開了牌，我沒說多少沒帶，映然對又不出聲，彷彿當我不存在，他在上路
    晃翔的我，沒任何開場白，可他最後的情緒全是無奈，腦袋空白，我和你細節操縱了，這次決定避開。為什麼我們的輸贏，還是沒有例外，你說我沒有操作，不懂兵線讓人下飯，為什麼抬舉不說，卻躲到了現在，他也不來了又被抓了，又找還是避開，為什麼我在你眼裡，是如此的下飯，我還是追了出去，不想踏下沙丘等待。卻不覺看著高低在我面前，我怕痛快，我還在等待，你會不會來，我還在等待，你會不會來，我還在等待，你會不會來，我還在等待。你會不會來。'
