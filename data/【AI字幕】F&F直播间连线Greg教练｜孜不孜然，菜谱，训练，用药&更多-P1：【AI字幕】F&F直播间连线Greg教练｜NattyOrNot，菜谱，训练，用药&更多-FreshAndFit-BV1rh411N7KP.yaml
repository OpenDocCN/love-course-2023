    it helps you as far as coaching people。。Well if you don''t have an education then
    how do you know what you''re talking about。。So when I''m making videos talking
    about things I think back。，Ok I have the education。I learned certain things。，But
    then I was able to apply it on myself and on others like in the real world。，Because
    a lot of times you read something。，But then you apply it and you''re like that

    got my Pro card on my 50th competition。。So I started competing in grade 12。，50th
    competition。，Mind you I did 42 shows natural。。And so I was on PDs。，I wasn't natural
    when I turned pro。，When I was natural I wasn't big enough。。I was in the 170s。，Got
    my Pro card。，I was about 195 pounds。。And the diet I mean it was always dieting。，Like
    literally。。I feel like I've been on a diet my whole life。，Greg I'm curious man。。So
    I have people that I know are going to competitions right。，And I'm just curious
    to know。。How many people in those competitions are actually natural or natty you
    think。。At the nationals like the show I did。，Probably no one。，Maybe one。，I mean
    almost nobody。。And the ones that are winning nobody。，Like there's no way。。I did
    I competed at nationals in the lighter divisions。，Like when I was a lightweight
    and so on。。I could win at that level。，But I mean the weight classes are like 150
    pounds。。But at the top level the guys winning Pro cards。，Like when you're 5 foot
    6 hundred ninety five pounds with 5 percent body fat。，You're not natural。，So almost
    nobody。，OK。，Fair enough。，So when you。，How long did you prep for that。。And you
    said you had done 50 shows prior。，Take us through that man。。And how long have
    you been training at that point。，

    everyone's like there's no way you're winning that。，You can't even beat a lightweight。，I'm
    like watch me。，I'm going to do it。，And so I just kept going。。And I got even leaner。，I
    showed up to the nationals like in the lower 190s。，Went on way more gear。。Like
    doubled everything up。，Added in trend。，I went on as much of anything as I could
    handle。。And showed up and won the show。，And got my pro card。，Greg。。How much is

  text: There's no way you can compete in bodybuilding at that level。，The diet people
    don't understand how hard it is。，Like most people they're like oh I don't want
    a burger。，I'm craving a burger and fries。，And they can't do it。，They might die
    to like 10 percent。。But I'm telling you every percent leaner。，It's 10 times harder。，You
    get to 6 percent。。You're shredded。，You're not even close to ready。，To get a pro
    card you need to be mind blowing shredded。，And so everyone can do it。，But do they
    want to or should they。，Probably not。。And so I think what helped me is I had this

    always worked so hard。。And so I took on bodybuilding as a huge challenge。，I'm

    me。，You don't know what I'm about。。I'm going to put everything into this。，And
    it came out on top eventually。，After 50 times trying。。And you know I think people
    kind of underestimate the difficulty it takes to get extremely lean。。Once you're
    you know when you're at 10 percent body fat you look pretty damn good。。You know
    you're on the beach。，Your veins are popping。，Abs are showing。，You look really
    good。。But once you get to like you know sub 10 percent。，You know you're going
    from 7 percent to 6 percent to 5 percent。，Each percentile is a significant increase

  text: How you have to have things on point etc。，Can you talk about how。，Because
    I've said this before。。Typically the better you look the worse you feel。，I can't
    express how horrible I felt dieting like to this level。，Like essentially the last
    month I can barely function as a human being。。Like no matter how good your diet
    is。，How much training you have。。No matter how many drugs you're taking。，And I
    was on all of them。。I had to get my girlfriend sometimes to get me out of the
    bathtub。。I couldn't drive myself to the gym sometimes。，Shoulder check。，I'm getting
    in car accidents。。I crashed my car underground one time。，I'm in a mess。，Like I'm
    wrecked。，That's how I feel。。I'm wrecked。，That's how hard it is。，And it's like
    you just keep going。。And the only reason I did this is because I was so good at
    it。。I was so determined to reach that goal。，It's kind of like climbing Mount Everest。。Every
    step higher towards the top it's that much harder。，It's thin air。，The bottom it's
    easy。。Halfway up you're like， "Ah， it's not bad。"，But man， when you're at the
    top it's so hard。。You can't live up there。，And so you have to come back down the
    mountain。。And that's why people are bulking and cutting as bodybuilders。，Because
    you can't maintain 3， 4。5 percent body fat year-round。，And you would just fall
    apart。。I couldn't physically nor mentally handle that。，So it is that hard。。And
    I would argue harder than you think to be that lean。，Absolutely。。I remember I
    bulked up all the way up to 250 for me。，That was fat。，

    energy to do anything outside of train。。And how long did that prep take you for
    the IFBB？，How long did you prep for？，6 months， 8 months？。Honestly， I was dieting
    the whole year，because I competed in that provincial championship where I won。，And
    then the next week， I had the Atlantic。，And then I was， I think。12 weeks out from

  text: It's still absolutely nearly impossible to do。，So 2 questions for you。。Number
    1， what should an average guy that's natty，，that isn't trying to compete or step
    on stage。be at as far as body fat percentage to look attractive？，That's part 1。，And
    then part 2。can you take us through gear usage，and should guys consider it？，Should
    they not？。Give us the pros and cons。，And you've been really transparent about
    gear usage，。which I think why so many people love you。，Some great questions。，Hopefully
    I'll remember all of them。，I'll start with the first one。，For just general fitness
    and health for men，，it's 15%。。And women add on 9%。，There's essential fat that
    women have to have。，So a woman， 15%。it's going to be shredded。，For men， 15% is
    going to look amazing。。And I actually did a video on this。，What body fat percentage
    do women prefer？。And anywhere from 10% to 15% for like 90% of women，，that's where
    they're going to like。。Not many girls are going for that shredded，，single-digit
    body fat。，They just don't like as much。。For general aesthetics， 10% to 12% is
    going to be shredded。，And for athletic performance，。that's usually where I try
    to get someone。，15% just for general health，。like you're going to feel good。，You're
    going to look good。，Anything lower than 15%，。it's not going to make you healthier，or
    more like live longer。，But in general，。it's going to make you look a little bit
    better，to the opposite sex depending on the person。。And so I would recommend 15%
    body fat for these people。，
- summary: "-   The prevalence of gear usage is higher than people think, with more\
    \ individuals using SARMs than steroids. Many people at the gym are on performance-enhancing\
    \ drugs, including those who may not fit the stereotypical image of a user. Transparency\
    \ about gear usage is important to dispel misconceptions and promote honesty in\
    \ the fitness community.\n    1.  Gear, including SARMs, is more common than perceived,\
    \ with about one in four gym-goers using it.\n    2.  Not all users fit the stereotype\
    \ of a muscular individual, as even those with higher body fat percentages may\
    \ use performance-enhancing drugs.\n    3.  Transparency about gear usage helps\
    \ to challenge assumptions and promote honesty in the fitness community."
  text: And so what's the next question？。And then the second question was，you're very
    transparent about gear usage，and gear in general。，Yeah。。Which I think is why so
    many people respect you。，We got a lot of fake natties running around。。We'll talk
    about fake natties as well，on your YouTube channel here in a second。，Facts。。But
    can you tell us a little bit about，how prevalent gear usage is。and why you chose
    to be so transparent about it？，There's way more people on， I'll call it gear。。I'll
    call it performance-enhancing drugs than people think。，And so for example，。people
    will often ask， steroids， steroids。，More people are on SARMs than steroids。。And
    SARMs are selective endogen receptor modulators，which are band performance-enhancing
    drugs。。Like they're easier to get。，They're often not used with a needle。。And so
    people are more comfortable with that。，And so it's way more common than people
    think。。I would say probably one out of every four people，that are at the gym that
    you see looking。and walking around are on it。，And oftentimes it's not the person
    that looks like me。。I'm only on 140 milligrams of test a week。，I've been on HRT。，I
    haven't done a cycle。。I'm not doing peptides。，Nothing else for nearly four years
    now。。But mostly people look at the biggest guy in the gym，and think that person's
    on it。。But they're not thinking about the people，that are， for example， 30% body
    fat，and have no muscle。and they just want to look average。，They just want to be
    able to take their shirt off。

    not telling anyone who's doing it。。But most of the time， it was average-looking
    people，that just wanted to fit in and be okay。。And those are the ones that were
    doing it。，Men and women。，You know what's funny， man？。So I'm in the gym now training
    a lot more as well， right？，And like my trainer's telling me，，Yo， bro。those guys

    decided to go to the dark side？，I was in my 30s。，So we're talking over 20 years。。I'd
    done 42 shows natural before I did anything。，I would go into natural contests，without
    even--。I don't want to say I didn't have to try，，but it was excessively easy，to
    win a drug-tested contest。because the level of physique was night and day。，And
    then when you enter an enhanced contest，。all of a sudden， I'm just one of the
    normal guys。，Like you go from really excelling in a drug-free event。to being just

  text: can we go over the main big ones，that people typically use and how they work？。The
    main steroids that people take？，Yeah， and--，because we know we're making jokes，，oh，
    yeah， Trenin。SARMs， and Anivar，，and all this other stuff， and testosterone。，People
    might not know the difference。，Can you give the people a quick little--，As far
    as steroids go， by far，。like not even-- nothing even close。，Like more people use
    this，than every other thing put together。。It'd be testosterone。，That's the basic
    male hormone。，That's what I'm on right now。。That's what my doctor prescribes。，Everything
    else is basically，a derivative of that。。It's basically testosterone，made in a
    different way，to give you a different kind of look。just to keep things simple。，And
    so most people are just using testosterone，at various doses。，However。there's orals，，and
    so a lot of people are taking，something like Anivar，。which would be probably the
    most common drug，for women， but it has a lot less side effects，。a lot less water
    and bloating，，and although it's more expensive。。So a lot of people are taking
    Anivar。，A lot of people would take Anivar。before they take an injectable，because
    not everyone's comfortable injecting。。So they don't want to do that。，Something
    like D-ball，would be very common， very popular，。but it's gonna make you a lot
    more puffy，，holding a lot of water。，Something like Tren，。although everyone jokes
    about it，，it's not used nearly as much，。maybe 20% as much as actual testosterone。，It's
    so much stronger。，

    it to stop，versus if I'm using testosterone，。I feel like Superman all the time。，Tren
    makes you feel like shit，，but you look great。。So that's the trade-off。，Gotcha。，What
    would your message be，to anyone that's thinking about。potentially going down，the
    road of the dark side？，The problem with it is。once you've had a taste for it，，it's
    very hard to stop，because you're gonna lose。at least half the gains，that you made
    while you're on it。，You're not gonna feel as good。after you stop。，Your sex hormones
    go in the dump。，I mean，that's on top of it。。Is it legal in your country？，Like
    in Canada， it's legal。，I can actually use it。。You can't get in trouble。，Other
    countries， it may not be legal。，But the downfall really is。that addictive nature，to
    feeling how you feel on it，，and so it's very hard to stop。。And so the problem，，people
    are like，，I'll just do one cycle。，I'll put on 20 pounds of muscle，。which they're
    not going to，，one in a hundred might，，and then they think，，I'll just keep it and
    stop，。and I'll be good。，But the problem is，，they go on，，get half the results they
    thought，they'd get，。then they get off of it，，and then they feel like shit。，They

    try that hard。，They're not sweating。。They're not pushing sets close to failure。，They're

    still training harder than almost everyone in the gym。。So that's my main thing。，I'm
    like most people， they're worried about reps and reserve reps between sets。sets，

    I need a coach or mentor，。or is this something that I can figure on my own？"，It's
    way easier with a coach。because if you don't have a coach，，you're not going to
    know how many calories to eat，。how fast to diet，，how lean you need to get。，You're
    not going to know how to pose properly。，Obviously。you can do it on your own without
    one，，but oh， my goodness，，
- summary: "-   Having a coach is crucial for success in physique competitions, as\

    \ coach is necessary for competing at a higher level and navigating the learning\

  text: it's so much better with a coach。。I'd strongly recommend you get a coach，who's
    worked with men's physique competitors before。。You can do it on your own，，but
    I wouldn't advise it。，It's a learning curve， bro。，Bro。if Ronnie Coleman，，Jay Cutler，，you
    know what I mean，，and all the top Olympia winners。all had coaches，，what makes
    you think that you're not going to need one？，Like， bro。having a coach is imperative，if
    you're going to compete at a higher level。，You just need it。。Doing it by yourself
    is almost impossible， bro。，Yeah， dude。。I would argue you need it more as a beginner，when
    you first start。，Like， people are like，，"Oh。I'll wing it as I'm a--，but as I'm
    at the Mr。 Olympia，，I'll need a coach。"，I'm like， "No。you need to learn how to
    start。"，And then once you're， like，，really good and know stuff，，like。I can coach
    myself， obviously。，But my first show， looking back，，I didn't know what I was doing。。I
    was eating pasta， no protein。，I didn't know that protein built muscle。，I'm a kid
    in high school。。So I was eating plain pasta。，I'm like， "I'll cut out the hamburger。，That's
    more calories。"。And I was eating muffins，because I thought muffins were healthy。。So
    I was eating muffins and plain pasta and dieting，，and I didn't know what I was
    doing。，I was like。"Horrible。"，Let me ask you this， Greg。，Let's say you had a show
    one year from now。。What steps would you take right here， right now，to prepare
    for that show？。I would start taking steroids tonight。，OK。，And then--，100%，

    he's doing work，and stuff like that。。It actually helps him keep lean，or he walks
    a lot as well。，He recommended some crazy videos。。He was saying you need to do，40，000
    steps a day in one video。。I made a video on him talking about that。，I'm like，
    dude， 40，000 steps。。Do you know how long that takes？，2300 steps is a mile for
    me。，I'm like， you're gonna walk。like for 4 to 6 hours a day，to get those steps
    in。，It works for sure，，but who got time to walk 40。000 steps？，Oh， shit。，Yeah。
    That's probably from the--，when he cycles，or when he walks on a treadmill。，He
    wakes up early in the morning，to do the morning walk。，Yeah。，He's also keto，。so
    he's not eating carbs。，So they probably benefits，from not having as much of an
    appetite。。Like he's limiting certain food groups。，People who eat less food groups，like
    less carbs，。they're often less hungry。，Problem is some people feel like，，shit，
    I can't follow that diet，。like a keto diet。，I can't do it。，I get brain fog。，It's
    just not for me。，Yeah。，And also with keto。right，，you're eating meat。，Meat is way
    more satiating，than anything else， right？，Yeah。。High protein meals，，much more
    satiating，，higher thermic effect of food，，bring up more calories，。digesting it，
    absolutely。，Absolutely。，Coach Greg is a real one。，Also。thanks for your frickin'
    cookbook。，Okay。 They love it。，JB says， "Love Coach Greg。，Thanks， FNF。for the dialogue。，Only
    2K likes on this vid。，Let's double it。"，Yeah， guys。

  text: ，We got 5，000 plus y'all。watching right now， timing。，Danny Brooke， W Collab，
    love you both。。I give Greg 2 years before he has enough，with Castro Juniors Canada，and
    moves to the U。S。，Much love。"，If I can get into the States，，I'll start with that。，Eat
    Clint Trenhard and never give up。。And that's from Captain Ahab。，I knew that was
    coming。，Captain Ahab。，You gotta love the misc。。And then Ever Blazer says，，"What
    up， FNF family？，Salute to the coach for a guy，that's 5'6"。about 145 pounds，，16%
    body fat。，Any tips on how to hit 160 pounds？"，A calorie surplus， of course。。Yes。，Greg，
    what do you suggest people hit，as far as like so they don't get fat。in their calorie
    surplus per day，if they're trying to build lean body mass？，No more than about
    5%。over what you're currently eating。，10% max， so the average person，，I would
    say eats 2。700 calories a day。，Now， mind you， the average male is overweight。。So
    most people should be eating less than that。，But all you need to do to gain weight，at
    a good rate。like a lean bulk，，5%， 10% tops。，So if you're eating 2，000，，it's only
    an extra 100 to 200 a day。。Very small。，You only need 30 calories extra a day，to
    build 4 to 5 pounds of muscle in a year，。which is the average person。，So I've
    often said，，"Hey， you only need 30 extra calories。"。And I know you can't track
    this，，but I'm only just doing that，because I understand math。。I taught math grade
    7 to 12，，so I know math very well。，But if you're adding in。100 extra calories
    a day，，I mean，

  text: ' that''s a lot of muscle a day。。You''re talking about 15 pounds-ish muscle，in
    a year that can be built on that。。Most people can''t build that much。，So if you''re
    even adding，100 calories a day，。probably some of it''s going to be body fat。，So
    very small surpluses。，-Yeah。，Charles。I got an offer to trade--，I got an offer
    to trade school for electrician。。My current job is pretty easy and pays decent，，but
    I would only make up to 80K a year。，I''m only 22。live with my dad。，With a car
    payment， that''s about it。，What''s the right move？，Bro， 80K per year。make it happen，，and
    then you can always scale up， bro，，because you can become--。you can become like
    a master electrician，，et cetera， so--。Where are these people living that 80K isn''t
    bad？，I was a school teacher making like 40。，Yeah， man。。Not wrong with that， guys。，And
    you''ll get a union。，You''ll get a good retirement，。a great skill to have，，and
    you can always--if you want，，you can start your own electrician business。。But--so，
    Greg， real quick with that。，So it''s Money Monday。，I got to ask you this。。How
    does someone monetize in the fitness industry，，and how did you do it？，Well。I guess
    how I do it or anyone do it，is you have to find something。that the people want
    and give it to them。，Like for me， it was like，，Coach Greg。can you make a cookbook？，Well，
    sure。，Like find something that you''re good at。and you''re passionate about，and
    then promote it to your audience，and try to sell it。。Like I''m not a guy that''s
    gonna--，like a fan of bulking。，'

    to gain weight，，well， why would I do that？，That's not about me。。Like so you have
    to go along with your brand，and what you stand for。，Like I promote cardio fitness，。and
    so I wrote a book。，Like， geez， the Circle Diet Book。，Like it's how to lose weight，。keep

    all this stuff。。So I offer people what they want，based on my expertise。，So whatever

    you don't mind disclosing。，I sold close to 100，000 copies。and they're between
    like $100 and $150 each。，So 15 million， maybe 10， 15 million，。something like that。，On
    a fucking cookbook。，Shout out to that。，That's what we're talking about， baby。，Shout
    out to all the haters，that got mad at you for selling it for $100。，High ticket
    closer。。No one's going to buy that。，You would sell。，You'd make so much more money，if
    you put the price down。。I'm like， really？，Well， I'm not going to tell you，how
    many I sold。，I mean， I didn't want everyone。to copy the book，because I was like，

    it can't be that good。。There's a supply and demand curve，and it's like， you know，，there's
    a certain price point。that's the right point。，I think I hit it。，Like， I mean，
    I did what I could do。，Yeah， Martha Stewart。probably selling her books，for a similar
    price。，So why not？，And she's a felon。，Well， for lying。。You for smuggling， right？，So，
    Greg， and then you said，the supplements。，Real quick， bro，。because you succeeded，in
    the supplement industry。，I've seen so many people。fail in the supplement industry。，It's
    very difficult。，You need a lot of money to get in。。It's not expensive，to produce
    the supplements。，And then also like the margins。aren't as much as people think。，Can
    you talk about，how you were able to build。a successful supplement company？，Well，
    because I did so many videos，on like steroids and supplements。and what I'm taking。，I
    have an IP pro card。，I've coached people，and people believe what I say。。So I have
    a respected opinion。，And so it's not just how many followers。。It's what kind of
    followers you have，and what you're famous for。，Like these TikTok girls and guys。and
    whatever and dancing around。，Like I've tried to sponsor them。，They do nothing。，They
    do no sales。because people aren't buying something。，If you have some pretty girl，and
    says， "It's bad。"，It's like。why？，You have to be able to explain things，so I can
    educate and teach people。。So I've been able to sell so much more，

    your word for it，then that's really important。，That's just how you do it。。Like
    other people，，they're just not good at talking about stuff，or they don't know
    anything about it。，Like how am I going to，how are you going to sell beta alanine，if
    you don't know why it works？。If you don't know what it does，what's it like？，You
    just-- no one's buying it。。So you have to be educated on it。，Yeah。，And I think
    also like the fact，that you're so honest，。you're so transparent，，especially in
    the fitness industry。where a lot of people are cappers and liars，and， "Oh， I'm
    Natty，"，and all this other stuff。。You went against the grain。，You're like， "No，
    I'm going to，tell the truth on what I really do。。I'm going to give you guys，my
    controversial takes，on certain social situations。"，And you know。when it comes
    to sales，，people like have to like， know， and trust you。。And I think that's another
    big thing as well。，You have a good amount of--，Yeah。，Like。think of what I'm talking
    about。，Like， my past， like selling--，like。all the shit I've done in the past，and
    I've been open book。，I'm like， "Yeah， that's true。。This is true。"，And so， like，
