    waste of time，There's of course a hundred different tiny bits of your face。that
    make up the attractiveness，but thinking about something that you can't change，is
    for losers。So let's go through in order of importance，Firstly， low body fat，This
    is obvious and common sense。but some guys still have too high of a body fat percentage。The
    ideal body fat that you should set the goal off，is around 10 to 12%。This is when
    your abs are completely visible，You may even have some veins around your abs and
    your V-line。and you'll have a sharp jawline，with no baggy skin underneath，One
    huge point that no one mentions。in terms of low body fat，is that to look even
    better，at a low body fat percentage。you want to weigh more，You simply want your
    body weight，to be as high as possible。whilst also remaining lean，and the way to
    do that is to bulk up first，and then cut to get leaner。This is what I looked like

- answers: '-   Proper breathing through the nose contributes to improved tongue posture
    and overall facial structure by allowing the tongue to rest against the roof of
    the mouth. This helps in developing a more natural and correct tongue posture,
    which in turn influences the alignment of the jaw and facial muscles, contributing
    to a more balanced and attractive facial appearance.

    -   Breathing through the nose offers several benefits in terms of opening up
    the airways and promoting correct tongue posture. Firstly, nasal breathing helps
    to naturally expand and clear the nasal passages, reducing congestion and allowing
    for better airflow. This leads to improved oxygen intake and respiratory function.
    Secondly, nasal breathing encourages the tongue to rest against the palate, promoting
    the correct tongue posture essential for proper craniofacial development and alignment.

    -   Achieving correct tongue posture involves positioning the tongue against the
    roof of the mouth in a specific manner. To achieve this, individuals should focus
    on pressing most of the tongue against the upper palate, ensuring that not just
    the tip but a significant portion of the tongue is in contact with the roof of
    the mouth. This practice, although requiring some initial effort and practice,
    becomes more natural over time and plays a crucial role in shaping the facial
    structure positively.

    -   Technology and phone usage often contribute to poor head posture, which can
    have adverse effects on facial attractiveness and overall health. Constantly looking
    down at screens, such as smartphones and computers, leads to a forward head position,
    causing strain on the neck and upper back muscles. This posture not only affects
    the alignment of the spine but also influences facial aesthetics, as it can result
    in a less confident and less attractive appearance.

    -   To improve and maintain proper head posture for better facial structure and
    appearance, individuals can employ various strategies and practices. One effective
    method is performing neck stretches to counteract the forward head position. Specifically,
    exercises like the "double chin stretch" can help strengthen the neck muscles
    and encourage better alignment. Additionally, being mindful of posture throughout
    the day, especially during technology use, and consciously making an effort to
    keep the head upright and shoulders back can contribute to long-term improvements
    in head posture and facial aesthetics. Regular neck strengthening exercises, such
    as neck curls performed with weights, can also help increase neck size, which
    is an important aspect of facial attractiveness and perceived masculinity.'

    chewing very soft， processed foods，Any food that's rough and hard like nuts。is
