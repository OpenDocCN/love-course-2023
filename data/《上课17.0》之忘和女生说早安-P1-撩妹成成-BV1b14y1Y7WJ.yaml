  text: '# 《上课17.0》之忘和女生说早安 - P1 - 撩妹成成 - BV1b14y1Y7WJI''m a little used to calling
    out such a name，I won''t see you tonight so I can keep from going insane。But I
    don''t know enough，I get some kind of lazy day。I''ve been fagging and screwing
    to find my title name。I''ll be stooped and moaned but I''ll leave us both the
    same，But I don''t know enough。I get some kind of lazy day，Cause it''s hard for
    me to lose in my life，I found only time will tell。And I will figure out that we
    can''t be better，We can do it one last time yeah。And it''s hard for me to lose
    in my life，I found outside your skin right near the fire。And we can''t be better，We
    can change and be alright，I''m a little used to wandering outside the rain。You
    can leave me tomorrow if it suits you just the same，But I don''t know enough。I
    need sun when it leaves the day，Cause it''s hard for me to lose in my life。'
